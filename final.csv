Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier

This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.


1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.

2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.

3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.

4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.

5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.

6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.

7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.

8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.

9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.

10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01)

 ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~

yes   81%
no    19%

Comments:
~~~~~~~~~

No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  

We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  

The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. 

Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>No. This is a funny thing to me.&nbsp; I hear about so many
<br>people being super scared to give out their SS#.&nbsp; Well folks,
<br>I can get your SS# for 50 cents.&nbsp; Give me a name and address
<br>and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
<p>We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
<br>the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
<br>they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.&nbsp; They could do
<br>who knows what with the CC number.&nbsp; I once had a person
<br>tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
<br>of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
<br>person (me) would have her account info and could write
<br>a check out for thousands of dollars.&nbsp; I told her to just send
<br>it to me then and she said that was OK.&nbsp; Then I asked her
<br>to tell me what the difference was between the original check
<br>and a fax copy.&nbsp; I told her to ask her lawyer that too.&nbsp;
Never
<br>heard back from her.
<p>The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
<br>available in many places.&nbsp; Have a good day.

<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
<br>we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
<br>importantly, never give any personal information at a site
<br>that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
<br>or a Veri secure sign or others.
<p>Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
<br>in my credit information in each time instead of having
<br>an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
<br>involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
<br>mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
<br>deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
<br>to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
<br>--&nbsp; Catherine F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com"">http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com</a>
<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
<br>my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
<br>was in a bad car accident.&nbsp; I had a full service account.
<br>My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
<br>went unprotected.&nbsp; A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
<br>and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
<br>address to a porn shop.&nbsp; Thus, I lost 4 years of building
<br>up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
<br>on 8 more.&nbsp; This set me back about 4&nbsp; months: I believe I
<br>lost a minimum of $50,000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.&nbsp; The first
<br>time I lost almost 4 months of work.&nbsp; Now, I back up often
<br>enough to not to lose so much time.&nbsp; This is also Internet
<br>theft.&nbsp; These people are nothing but out and out criminals
<br>and should spend years behind bars.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
<br>however, merchants can lose a lot of money.&nbsp; I sell only by
<br>purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

4,4,adv: Put your resume back to work,"Dear Candidate,

We recently came across a posting of your resume on the Internet.   After our 
research, we determined that it was not posted on over 45 other top job sites. 
The impact to you is that over 83% of the employers and recruiters looking to 
hire candidates with your skills are not reading your resume.  

Is your resume taking the day off?  
While most people post their resumes on the top three job sites, such as Monster, 
HotJobs, and CareerBuilder, there are many other specialized job sites that employers 
and recruiters use to find candidates.  

When those specialized job sites are combined with the top three job sites, your 
resume is read by nearly 100% of the employers and recruiters who are looking 
to hire or place candidates with your skills.

To: <Undisclosed Recipients>					
Subject: Earn money sending e-mails.  It's easy!
	     NEW IMPROVED reports

Dear Friend,

You can earn a lot of money in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
Seem impossible? Is there a catch?  NO, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom. 

Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then
people send me cash in the mail for information that I just e-mail
back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.

Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you
like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.

""AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION"" 

""Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS
TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following.
This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money. 

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home. And, besides even if you never
got involved in the program, the reports themselves are well worth
the money.  They can help you start and advertise ANY business on
the internet.  That is, these reports stand alone and are
beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet.

The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will
understand once you experience it. 

""HERE IT IS BELOW"" 

*** Print This Now For Future Reference *** 

The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in
taking a look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment
($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!! 

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY. 

It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house
except to get the mail. 

Simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this
happen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if
you put in the effort to make it work. E-mail is the sales tool of
the future. Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW! 

The longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your
business using e-mail. Get what is rightfully yours. Program
yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but
it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief
system in place. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods. 
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. 

You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work. 
The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!"" 

With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business. 

Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others. 

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.

My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my
business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened
in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! 

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's
prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. All of the programs
I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one
year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! 

But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! 
After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it
correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. 

Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. 

I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN
LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT."" 

Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am
telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I
promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me. 
Here is the basic version of what you need to do: 

Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND
OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. 

Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2
within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. 

Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.
Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. 

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT
#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,
1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done. 

By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more
than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! 

In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,
I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security. 

If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke 

P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur. 

Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working. 

Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945. 

I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. 

The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor. 

As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.""
The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that. 

You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK""and ""JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined. 

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them! 

Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach. 

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW! 

""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody
Jacobs, Richmond, VA 

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ 

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. 

Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE
FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do it privately in your own home, store, or office. 

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do. 

1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell
them if you don't have them). 

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &
RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem). 

*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF
ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! 

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them. 

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 

2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. 

a. Look below for the listing of available reports. 

b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement
and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! 

c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. 

d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. 

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3 

f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. 

g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position. 

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy
and paste method works well,.

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction
portion of this letter. 

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet
Connection and e-mail is FREE! 

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. 

Here are two primary methods of building your downline: 

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL 

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. Using a good list, the response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order REPORT #2. 

Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about
level five!  That's $500,000 alone!

Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that and more! 

REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software. 

METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 

1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.
Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10
downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING
results below: 

1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000 
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000 
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000

THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550 

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants. 

THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! 

AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND
NAME *** 

* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of
those sheets of paper include: 
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and 
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS ******* 

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately. 

* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the requested product/report. 

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. 

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! 

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! 

******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* 

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 

Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?
Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when
they email you, send them this report in response! 

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 

Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders
for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! 

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business! 

Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program: 

1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO
PRODUCE! 

2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP! 

3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO
ADVERTISE! 

4. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE
WORLD! 

5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS
YOUR TIME! 

6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS
PURE PROFIT! 

7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. 

******* TESTIMONIALS******* 

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm
living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR 

My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that
I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer
now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more
years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL. 

The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in. 
-Charles Morris, Esq. 

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. 
-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA 

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA 

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy
spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY

Folks, the summer�s upon us here in the nation�s capital. And, matching the

               Is Bin-Laden the Pawn of China?

On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from 
Beijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban 
had ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that 
Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director 
George Tenet received a coded ""red alert"" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a ""worst case scenario"" -- that China 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.  In 
SEEDS OF FIRE, Gordon Thomas asks the question: In the war on terror, is China 
with us or against us?  Click here:

18,18,YOUR POWER SUPPLY IS KILLING YOUR ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT,"Did you know that???

Fact:	Every electrical system suffers from power surges?

Fact:	80% of electrical equipment damage is caused by surges - also known
as 'spikes'.  These spikes can damage sensitive electronics in computers
to heavy industrial motors.

Fact:	These spikes or surges hit your electrical circuits up to 400,000
times per hour.  Your electrical equipment is being gradually and
sometimes suddenly destroyed.

Fact:	OUR RANGE OF SURGE ARRESTORS will reduce your operating costs
dramatically by extending the life of all your electrical and electronic
equipment.

Motors run cooler, your fluorescent lighting life is doubled.  Your
equipment works more efficiently and your energy costs fall.

Fact:	THE SAVINGS you make in electrical consumption, electrical repairs,
electronic repair, telephone and data systems protection and lighting 
replacements can cover the cost of installing our surge and lightning
arrestors.

Even more importantly no sudden, dramatic system failure caused by
	lightning, surges and spikes.

Now you know!!

marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most
important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The
pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their
friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is
fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't
yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of
income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell
you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard
of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the
information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type
""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to
you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your
Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Looking4Money 

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And
it's FREE!

26,26,Awiating your fax response.,"(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  

Dr. Kataga Bakori
Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002


Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.

Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.

The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.

 the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. 

I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.

Thanks for your co-operation,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Kataga Bakori

NB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1

27,27,Special Affiliate Offers from Amazon.Com!," 

                  Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America!
�...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" 
America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, 
this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is 
no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals 
comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the 
impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" 
Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a 
typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an 
unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular 
neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have 
been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young 
""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby 
carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also 
noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying 
them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the 
absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their 
respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard 
stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly 
mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know 
that many young African American women refuse to date African 
American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In 
fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who 
represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as 
""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young 
African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while 
living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" 
rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make 
investments?
 
    ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story!
 
These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering 
through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare 
Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, 
and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African 
American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths 
that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have 
you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds 
light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of 
""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the 
rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many 
young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The 
writer supports his arguments with direct references to the 
overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to 
raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish 
criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes 
being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or 
cool neighborhood reputation.
 
The author also identifies the self-destructive and often 
criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily 
basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, 
robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing 
expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior 
committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a 
lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless 
homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with 
the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in 
the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations 
are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack 
of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" 
today. To learn more about this dynamic self contained society

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.  

Opex's usual rates are 4.5 cents per minute for domestic calls, with great international rates, too!

The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

Subject: Info on using Linux operation system?

In answer to the question in Exchange Issue #441, 
WonderPaint gave a pretty darn good explanation of 
what is going on in windows.  He suggests Linux.  

My question is can the current software on my machine 
use Linux if I were to switch to that OS and if not, how 
much software is available for Linux.  Seems all I find is 
for windows and some for the mac.  Thanks.

Hello Nicety,

I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall, http://www.wonderpaint.com,  
when he wrote in Exchange Issue #441:

<snip>
 One major problem is that many programs don't release memory 
when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the 
approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, 
</snip>

I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much 
negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer 
for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's 
favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I 
have to make it do anything useful. 

If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE 
download called FreeMem which you can get here;
http://www.meikel.com

This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you 
also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. 
This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be 
running at peak performance all the time and much easier than 
constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these 
little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to 
search for.

HTH.  Tony.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #141:  http://www.floridarental.co.uk
Carol Hall
carol@floridarental.co.uk
~~~~

Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe
just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around
your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone
three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to
make your front page navigation a little less confusing?

The ""next page"" tab is right next to one that says ""bookmark
this page"" - no information until you mouseover the tab to
tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed
with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not
enough information on your openning page.
~~~~

I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL
ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.
1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the
animation and red text on the yellow background, missing
the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more
details to this important introduction. Instead of using the
'click here' button, just have a text link following directly
after the introduction.
2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,
and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on
what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text
on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially
when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the
important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.
3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but
you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed
menu and the pages are all untitled.

I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you
want the best site you can have and I think these changes
will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the
site you have the information organized and complete. I
even wanted to come and stay!
~~~~

The animations make this site look amateurish from the
beginning.  The flashing ""Bookmark This Site"" makes me
want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans
MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve
this site.
~~~~

I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the
first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between
them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know
where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should
have been up by the text and that is where I should go.

On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,
the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One
suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have
the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of
the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.

The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and
laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.
Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but
if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten
that far.
~~~~

This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read
and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.
Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste,
but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold
of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that
form a background for some images.

48,48,SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,"
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

54,54,[dcms-dev] MY INHERITANCE,"Date:May 16,2002. 
Email:edum@hkem.com. 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal 
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the Southern African region of the African continent. 
The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA 
government of my country.The rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently 
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. 
Needles to say I was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.The result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This 
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in South Africa. I 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to 
take possession of the money that I kept with them. 
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola 
(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.Please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
Yours truly, 
Eduado de Mello

57,57,Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKN,"How are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

Хотите узнать, какая профессия в IT вам
подходит?

Собрали мини-гайд по пяти популярным
профессиям в индустрии. Узнайте, кто
приумножает деньги компаний, а кто
легально ломает программы.

Кто такой программист и чем занимается?

Специалист, который разрабатывает
программное обеспечение с помощью
написания
кода на любом языке программирования
под определённую платформу.

Базовое разделение программистов:

Фронтенд

Разработчики этого профиля создают
понятный интерфейс: макет страницы,
яркие
кнопки и удобное поле заявки.

Бэкенд

Здесь разработчики продумывают
невидимую логику: куда именно упадёт
заявка
пользователя и как оптимизировать
работу сервиса.

Фулстек

Это разработчики, которые работают и с
фронтендом, и с бэкендом.

Кто такой тестировщик и чем занимается?

Специалист, который проверяет
работоспособность продукта. Это может
быть
веб-сайт, мобильное или
десктоп-приложение, программное
обеспечение или игра.
Тестировщик моделирует ситуации,
которые могут возникнуть во время
работы с
программой, чтобы найти ошибки и
исправить их.

Выделяют два направления тестирования:

Ручное

Тестировщик получает техническое
задание, затем описывает сценарии:
какую работу
будет делать и какой результат ожидает
получить. Затем делает monkey testing:
вручную проверяет сервис, пока не
наткнётся на ошибку.

Автоматизированное

Инженер по тестированию пишет
программу на Python или Java под
определённый
продукт. Программа автоматически
прогоняет, к примеру, страницы сайта и
отправляет отчёты об ошибках
разработчикам.

Кто такой аналитик и чем занимается?

Специалист, который собирает и
обрабатывает информацию, формирует
различные
отчёты. Он помогает бизнесу принимать
взвешенные решения, сводит данные и
строит
прогнозы.

В аналитике огромное количество
направлений, приведём несколько
примеров:

– BI-аналитики. Специалисты, которые
формируют отчёты, на основе данных с
панелей мониторинга, визуализируют их
в понятные отчёты для бизнеса.

– Финансовые аналитики. Всегда знают
реальные источники прибыли и видят
новые
ниши для роста бизнеса.

– Продуктовые аналитики. Анализируют
воронки поведения пользователей и их
обратную связь, чтобы улучшить продукт.

Кто такие проджект- и продакт-менеджер
и чем они занимаются?

Продакт-менеджер

Специалист, который в установленные
сроки с установленными ресурсами
собирает
команду, реализовывает продукты
согласно тем требованиям, которые ему
дали.

Проджект-менеджер

Специалист, который в установленные
сроки с установленными ресурсами
собирает
команду, реализовывает продукты
согласно тем требованиям, которые ему
дали.

В чём разница: проджект-менеджер, как
правило, работает с внутренней
командой и
реализовывает проект по техническому
заданию. А вот продакт-менеджер
придумывает
продукт, его стратегию и
позиционирование на рынке.

71,71,"Earn $139,000 a year as a DAY TRADER!","It was the Spring of 1979.  

I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...

Stealing other kids' lunch money.

No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said,
""and I'll bring you five dollars next week.""  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.

Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.

I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.

Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.

First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.

Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.

The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
""NEVER"".  

In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:

Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?

Hell no!

You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  

The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.

If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.

What I'm talking about here is day trading.  

My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. 

The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  

I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.

Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  

The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  

Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.

They make their money only if you believe two lies:

1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.

2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.

Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...

The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  

After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:

** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.

** Anyone can do it.

** It only takes a few hours to learn.

When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.

After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.

The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. 

Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year 

After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. 

Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:

*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.


*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.


*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 


*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.


*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 


*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 


*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.


*** Make money on the biggest news stories.


*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 


*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.


*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 


It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?""

Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?

With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.

The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.

Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  

Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.

In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.

But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.

You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.

81,81,Blessing People,"Hi There,

I wanted to spread this good karma to you.

This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.

I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.

I am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.

Please help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!

85,85,[ILUG] MICHAEL ! ilug," ilug ,

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

90,90,BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP(URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL),"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.

94,94,[ILUG] MICHAEL ! ilug," ilug ,

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !
confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!
 regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.
I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS
GEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON
(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I
WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND
NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT
EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN
CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL
PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND
ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.
FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX

120,120,Lose 28 Pounds In 10 Days                     30201,"Long time no chat!

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!  

To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

I also have received both the virus and email on how to get 
rid of it.  Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm 
expecting them and then am still very careful.  

Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing:

One Fix Tool:

Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive
C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS.
http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com

Another Trojan Fix Tool
http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com
The fix tool will run from your desktop and will ""automatically"" 
rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an 
entries from your registry files.

After running either fix tool -- reboot your system.

Hope this helps!

Dear Nicety,

As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking 
up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.  
There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts 
resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many 
programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working 
in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a 
regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened 
and closed several different applications.

Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,
wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating
system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at 
http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is 
even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about 
on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. 

 So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change 
the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of 
weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running 
I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. 
I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and 
the price is right -- free.

SITE  REVIEWED!

Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding
Margarete
MDegaston@aol.com
~~~~

I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate 
sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well 
presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been 
a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, 
preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a 
relationship to it.

What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something 
related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this 
""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to 
click in the first place.

I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and 
not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the 
book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)

With these:

Find out how you can receive the free book.
Email us at directions4U@aol.com        
and
For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing 
write to us at directions4U@aol.com

I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than 
copy and paste.

Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. 
(and I have ordered the book!)
~~~~

I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  
Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics 
or where we were headed.
~~~~

Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.

Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish 
between the links and that which is not.

I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also 
linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that 
link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.

If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a 
request message to an aol email address you would get more 
requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
~~~~

I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  
If only other sites we so simplistic!
~~~~

With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact 
on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences 
in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box 
with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of 
'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended 
to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 
year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of 
using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where 
or how or by whom it was discovered.

The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that 
would make the site more effective (on getting people to request 
the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in 
what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to 
order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form 
for this just about anywhere.

135,135,Fw: The Gold Buddha,"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.

Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.

Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.
Get a financial checkup and a free video on how to become ""Financially Fit
For Life"" and discover the gold within your current income.

140,140,Never pay eBay listing fees again!,"Hi,

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.

Here goes ...

Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!

All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!

Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 

Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
successful, high profit bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

** THE BULKBOOK
Teaches you step-by-step how to become a high profit
bulk emailer.  Secret techniques and tips never
before revealed.

$499.  I am giving you the whole bundle for only $29.99.

                   Urgent Concern Pls.

I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK,
consumer Banking Department. Although we didn't have previous correspondence till date.
However, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is thus:
I've a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also 
receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share.
However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an  out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA.
At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an  accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange.
This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks.

Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund.
Please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer 
has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund.
Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of 
need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent
messages. 
I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. 

Be guided.

Thanking you .Yours sincerely,

Dave Framo.

Money Judgment is and </FONT>
<FONT color=""#0000A0""> why processing Money Judgments<BR>
can earn you very substantial income</FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000"">  .<BR>
<BR>
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you<BR>
will have a Money Judgment against them.<BR>
<BR>
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the<BR>
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the<BR>
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>
when they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>
dime.""<BR>
<BR>
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>
proportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>
between </FONT>
<FONT color=""#0000A0""> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<BR>
Judgment debt</FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000"">  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>
Judgments take its place.<BR>
<BR>
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>
techniques necessary to succeed.<BR>
<BR>
With our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
By following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>
processing of Money Judgments.<BR>

The income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>

have associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>
and $100,000.00 per year </FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000""> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>
offices.<BR>
<BR>
Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>
for reports.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>
payment of the principal.<BR>
<BR>
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=""#0000A0""> 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%<BR>
are women and 36% are part time</FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000"">  .<BR>
<BR>
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>
are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>
<BR>
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>
are. You are not a collection agency.<BR>
<BR>
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>
are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>
to write to)<BR>
<BR>
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>
unless you want to.<BR>
<BR>
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>
<BR>
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>
companies charge $25.00.<BR>
<BR>
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>
course)<BR>
<BR>
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>
the original Judgment holder.<BR>
<BR>
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>
<BR>
Quote's from several of our students:<BR>
<BR>
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop<BR>
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>
<FONT color=""#0000A0""> My<BR>
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000"">  . Your<BR>
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened<BR>
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.<BR>
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of<BR>
judgments he is working on.<BR>
<BR>
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in<BR>
area code 314 stated to us: "" </FONT>
<FONT color=""#0000A0""> I am now making $2,000.00 per<BR>
week </FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000""> and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the<BR>
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in<BR>
judgments I am collecting on now.""<BR>
<BR>
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated<BR>
"" </FONT>
<FONT color=""#0000A0""> I am now making $12,000.00</FONT>
<FONT color=""#000000"">  per month and have approximately<BR>
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I<BR>
will have to hire someone to help out""<BR>
<BR>
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only<BR>
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I<BR>
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>
your course for 5 months""<BR>
<BR>
>From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>
why we can state the following:<BR>
<BR>
With our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>
A business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>
retire on and travel the world. A business which is<BR>
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every<BR>
day is new and exciting.<BR>
<BR>
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is<BR>
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate<BR>
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from<BR>
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full<BR>
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from<BR>
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you<BR>
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen<BR>
for many others already. Make it happen for you!<BR>
<BR>
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you<BR>
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation<BR>
on your part.<BR>

Previous News Releases and Announcements
Their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies
are in black type.
June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or
placed by you or under your control:
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has
condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the
DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for
Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an
alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France-
Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to
countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by
representatives of either nation.""
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early
1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall
Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled
the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has
disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of
2/1/00)
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of
false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom
of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a
serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how
distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of
my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am
obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully
offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your
text will be set off (with ""**"") in color:
**DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti.**
(Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall
Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in
which case a reader may be misled.)
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern
Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific.
**However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent
assertions"" of two organizations, ...**
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the
'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true?
Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been
internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud,
abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every
financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to
serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for
the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign
invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their
own corrupt government?)
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the
Marshallese name for Wake Island),...**
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for
DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister
nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is
not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a
deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the
sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and
irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources
anymore?)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and
the same could be said for DOM.
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged
investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.**
(Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people
of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands
and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for
perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse""
has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands
government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not
now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have
tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources
for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also
will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are
currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have
in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate
entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists
use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't
anybody check sources anymore?)
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries
against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of
either nation.**
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of
which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published
information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against
acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of...""
nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that
effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any
RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the
credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral
sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the
Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his
will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will
happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of
lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and
they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their
jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.)
**A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the
early 1990s.**
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu
in the early 1990s.)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and
6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount
Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and
was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign
state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King
over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established
government as a limited constitutional monarchy.
**It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands
paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf.**
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted
brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the
post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a
Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific
instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from
Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the
people's behalf.
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and
ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.**
(Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The
Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special
Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of
EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no
political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of
Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not
incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was
it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of
any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any
statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.)
Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more
research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion
of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before
arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you
to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents
mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace')
and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site.
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected
elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above
in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the
author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio'
correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request
for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author
regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio.
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet
can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December
10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation
once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According
to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was
leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of
EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims
the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands.""
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article
of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00)
Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press
release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under
a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an
act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal
authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall
Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to
publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a
suitable land base for its people to administer their form of
government.
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day
of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a
state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our
governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had
nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert
Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not
convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence.
This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of
landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to
Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount
Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction.
Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by
Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios.
Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter
case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of
Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr.
Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998,
the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of
the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll
(a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names).
For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in-
cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a
completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign
of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive
intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your
journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be
proved accurate.
I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment
and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric
history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named
by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and
missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the
public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and
most of which are referenced or published at our official web address:
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be
added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from
one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00).
""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the
Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a
U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for
recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and
pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.
The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests
took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the
illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of
the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of
an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's
independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after
the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as
Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American
businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls,
which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.""
Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward
facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet
since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced
text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very
serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke,
which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your
summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios
and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line
by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off
(with ""**"") in color:
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall
Islands of the western Pacific.**
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western
explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in
Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean.
The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the
role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory.""
**After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional
chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part
of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll,
called Enenkio locally.**
Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific,
which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of
the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well
established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and,
having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese
invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak
atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands
of Eneen-Kio Atoll.
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions
here.""
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.**
Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the
Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its
move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional
landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios.
The Author responds: ""I will note this.""
**The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993
acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment
by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.**
Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after
precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged
the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of
Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the
following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People.
**King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the
northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.**
Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death
in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994,
whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited
constitutional monarchy.
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here.""
**The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained
its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary
in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore
land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared
the Dominion of Melchizedek.**
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his
brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today.
To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have
nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since
HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak
atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10
atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story,
which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have
offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct
your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our
pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and
interest in this matter.
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's
Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources
& Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I
will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response,
Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the
next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background:
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the
Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0
(discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar,
Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His
Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or
state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the
said ""press release"" is indeed an official document.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that
representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King
Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right
and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons,
many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall
Islands.
Response to so-called ""Press Release"":
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also
unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an
unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon
Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the
U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report)
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall
Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio:
Â» Â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo
Convention (1933).
Â» Â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its
sovereign,
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987.
Â» Â» was established by way of a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.
Â» Â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many
other
states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek
Â» Â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over
islands
and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries.""
Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional
and
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred
heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI
Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak
atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Â» Â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its
political
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and
seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of
Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the
Marshall Islands.
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall
Islands:
Â» Â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the
Montevideo
Convention (1933).
Â» Â» was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign
governments,
which included the United States, China and the USSR.
Â» Â» was also established under a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people.
Â» Â» has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of
anything that is not also public information and no such public
information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has
ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar.
Â» Â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the
islands
and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in
1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any
present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to
the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter.
Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution,
which
does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over
territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio
Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant
matter.
Â» Â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom
of
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the
suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of
Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to
coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap
Hermios.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements
or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility,
existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in
the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication
by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as
deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His
Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of
EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate
responsive measures.
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom
of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following
statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands,
then you decide for yourself:
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace
and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the
aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and
striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal.""
On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom
of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a
free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background:
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on
reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics
and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC,
February 1999, states as follows:
""Where Are OFCs Located?
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction
anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest
OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote
areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere
figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek
(sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in
intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center]
Response:
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble
citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible
categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an
unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His
Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs
thereof.
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt
to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics
trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels,
terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without
even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate
such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United
States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the
United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the
United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of
power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United
States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional
representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised
of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in
kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of
Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic
cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

March 16, 1999: News Release
The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios,
First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern
Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was
felt throughout the society.Â  Flags were flown at half mast for a
week
in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the
world.Â  His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the
highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom.
Â 
His Majesty King Remios Hermios
Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio
He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will
formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head
of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.Â 
His
Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and
maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be
his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios.

March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration
The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of
interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â  The
United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism,
appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in
""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State,
which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â  The
explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by
agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments
of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many
Marshallese.Â  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and
outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not
healed.
Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â  Following four years of
attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the
Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to
Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese
King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the
world.Â  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept
as
virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue
of being kept out.Â  It was through this pragmatic initiative that
the
Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon
the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the
ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios.
In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â 
While a
state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past
wrongs remains on the horizon.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not
condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or
agent of any government.Â  Such unnecessary means would diminish any
hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the
cause of peace within the family of nations.Â  The Kingdom of
EnenKio
also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of
the Marshallese people.
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the
U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter,
conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination,
preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses,
it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the
people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â  The refusal
of
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple
discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with
representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity,
turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of
the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute
the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â  Your
understanding is appreciated.Â

December 19, 1998: News Release
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the
occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio,
His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts
are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999.
Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made
his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of
traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a
family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved.
Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as
Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and
High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as
our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to
be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a
successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be
announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head
of State.
HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as
Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the
Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first
discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a
well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by
force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western
ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and
beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally
occupied by the federal government of the United States.
In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios
clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in
interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio
Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the
Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of
the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official
Internet site.
On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely
grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and
are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be
recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people
by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese
domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has
passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese
ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the
mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best
wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to
all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents
Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have
been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands
government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more
admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for
disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased
report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding
the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are
cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or
concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the
State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply:
The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No
claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any
claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in
the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the
ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of
war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as
an honorable state among nations.
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting
authority over land ...within the geographical and political
boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed
imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of
Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish
there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one
has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue
be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous
weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our
shirtsleeves, our raison d'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble
to
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site:

""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was
advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver
licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of
EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary,
our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so
steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are
advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such
an act is patently illegal.
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap
Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I
have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and
ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the
statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its
territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to
their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by
Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney.""
HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the
northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of
his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens
who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and
peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic]
(actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is
the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300
miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker
applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society
writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning
of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the
First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first
pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the
Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997.
First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First
Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time
following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are
encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint
mailing list.
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the
government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution
in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the
island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of
the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended
recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship
are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA
and elsewhere.
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake
Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned
names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people
in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the
atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant
jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and
cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the
government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial
title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at
the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar
fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful
return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by
Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the
Monarchy.
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to
top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a
virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the
blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from
United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to
request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related
factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific
Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the
atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom
have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal
advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events
and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the
world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights
violations by federal agents of the United States government.
INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and
dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium
nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the
basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets
varies according to the value and stability of national currency units,
the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with
any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the
stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be
determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are
printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended
for use as money.
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people
from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of
EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In
doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the
federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with
human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from
the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom
and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top
Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the
United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts
that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF
ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most
recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One
of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a
Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding
the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United
States.
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of
disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the
government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with
similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the
premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and
compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal
action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal
government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal
announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and
failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world
regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by
the United States.
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three
small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for
Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue
is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land
tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal
chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United
States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in
1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple
landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war
missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of
the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a
cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the
East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was
destined to become a military installation.
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President
by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of
correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without
establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the
first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood
from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that
jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not
establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA
(predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base
for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called
annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently
illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.
When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally
significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent
was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake
Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak
chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of
Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall
group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was,
the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at
Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby
activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or
quintessential knowledge by the American public.
Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian
Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there
being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel
Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in
sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder
of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title.
The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from
aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its
Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures
the rights of ownership.
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the
administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration,
""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island
nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or
unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom,
over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that
truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of
power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the
record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are
all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it
comes to seizure of land and denial of rights.
In the Declaration, demands are made as follows:
Â» Â» ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an
honorable
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."".
Â» Â» ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to
submit to
Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR
reparations to citizens.""
Â» Â» ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone...""
Â» Â» ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in
commerce by failure the Department of the Interior
Â» Â» ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more
than
TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a
Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is
obligated to pay.""
Â» Â» That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to
immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating
the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights
and due process..."".
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable
nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the
Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a
peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of
the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly.
Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll,
titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern
atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall
Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe!
The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you
to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to
take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take
appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as
you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy
insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the
federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your
anonymity and that of your publication is well served.
Summary of Events 1993-94:
Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment
of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as
Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two
announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii
said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu
newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island
airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another
military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994;
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama
issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch
program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to
believe.
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was
held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under
the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of
independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as
king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the
first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake
I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant
impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature
into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its
sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership
claims.
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the
nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His
Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr.
Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution,
Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted.
On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into
law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the
USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the
people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent
peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as
owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and
embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of
democratic government.
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world
proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were
presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation
requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United
Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others.
Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request
for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council.
On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent
via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding
the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the
islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued
disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms
of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall
Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged
receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now
in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million.
The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994,
relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent,
only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands
Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then
only briefly.
Request for Media Response:
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural
calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and
deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a
new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an
aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth
of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about
suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the
security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of
""world leadership""? Or is it world domination?
People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an
effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby,
hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of
their ancestral heritage:
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed
invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper
annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized
by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for
at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and
validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a
fabrication.)
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of
specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack
thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my
understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing""
of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war,
technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds
against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop
serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the
king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the
citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their
government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and
fiscal manner.
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of
questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation,
offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research,
environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note:
Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island
and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets
and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less
publicized projects.)
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with
regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by
King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored
and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human
rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and
conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal
to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military
and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology
for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year
and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious
significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio
citizens.)
Parting Shot:
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in
general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow
behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the
right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest
inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an
approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner
of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright
alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent
trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports,
forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and
virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have
escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government.
Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable
thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry
of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a
century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only
be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of
American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and
inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States
by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures
and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from
matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in
determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to
know; the media a responsibility to show them.
In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is
one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political
philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives
for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human
cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual
rights.
Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and
forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands
which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty,
King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister
Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of
Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials
in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing
came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the
illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by
the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899.
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value
and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common
Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King
Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S.
claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human
rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also
establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to
answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand
valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was
made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land.
Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per
month through 1995.
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S.
officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which
keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory
exile.
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a
small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands,
including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal
chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for
religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC.
During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and
explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the
real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the
islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who
recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill
Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy.
King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief
(Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the
Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll.
Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the
islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of
restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most
recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air
Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii.
Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu
Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air
Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much
activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"".
According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private
entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a
stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral
heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people.
Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation
under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate
and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to
direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as
a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive
Council.
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the
effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any
substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers
and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the
recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the
lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios:
Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al
Gore
in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in
their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were
ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more
than a decade ago.
Â» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the
proposed
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of
protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated
launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into
the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered.
Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket
launch
activities and requesting help went unanswered.
Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which
declared the
status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the
administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise
ignored.
After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the
declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United
States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council.
They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied
access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of
Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the
Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government
recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his
family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio .
While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of
foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included
agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of
Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the
past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the
future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace.
Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the
United States.
Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S.
Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President
Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall
Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges
superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of
ownership and use of land.
Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military
might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations
(e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other
Ministers and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully
displace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His
Majesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document
was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up
in International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
In an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the
restoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international
recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the
Sovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent
documents of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations
Security Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations
and to the governments of most other nations of the world.
It is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment
of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and
relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time,
Mr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to
inform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or
by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is
made to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of
EnenKio.

For your kind attention,


              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.


Yours Faithfully

BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************

Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.

Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.

Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.

Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.

Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.

Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.

Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.

This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.

Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************

=======REST OF MESSAGE======================

With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!

READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.

= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =

If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.

===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================

Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.

Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.

Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.

Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.

If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)

If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795

If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.

There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.

METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.

The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.

===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.

PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.

=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
===========================================
A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.

Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
emails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember, the more you send out the more potential
buyers you will reach.

IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND
EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!

Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the
Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights:
(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the
GUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign
to your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer
to resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1
is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's
free of charge and will give you the tools you need.

The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES
is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to
resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the
internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.
YOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR
DISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the
Guides for your own personal use to enhance your
communication skills.

Dear Friend,
                
We are desparately looking for 100 lazy people
who wish to make lots of money without working.

We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.
We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich
quick' scheme offered on the internet.
We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful
people, career builders or even college graduates.
We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.

We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and
gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.
We want the people who stay in bed until noon.
We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go
lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.

If you meet this criteria, go to this site and join free:

http://www.roibot.com/w.cgi?R64190_funprogram

In case you haven't figured it out yet, we want
the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.
If you are the kind of person who will consider doing
something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.
This is too easy a way to make money
and there's no challenge in it.

If you can get to the website, you will be able to see the first home 
business in history that requires no work.  NONE.

By clicking on this link and going to
this website, you will be aknowledging the fact that you
want to make enough money that you can quit
your regular job and sleep all day.

We are not looking for a commitment from you
and we don't even want your money.
As a matter of fact, we don't even want you
to hear from us again if the idea of making lots
of money without working does not interest you.

So if nothing else, remember this -

to make money without working for it just
""Join Free"".  Simple as that.

http://www.roibot.com/w.cgi?R64190_funprogram 


We look forward to hearing from you.

In all seriousness,

This is NOT a ""no work"" program that will make you money without lifting 
a finger. 

Advertising effectively requires WORK and plenty of it. Oh, for sure, it's 
not like picking cotton under a broiling sun, but it IS work, nonetheless. 

And we DO want peoples' money ONLY when they see the value of our 
products, services and upgrades. 

We look forward to hearing from you. 

Cordially your lazy friend,

197,197,[ILUG-Social] re: how to register one of the new domain extensions,"IMPORTANT DOMAIN INFORMATION:


The new domain names are finally available to the general public at discount prices. Now you can register one of the exciting new .BIZ or .INFO domain names, as well as the original .COM and .NET names for just $14.95. These brand new domain extensions were recently approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original .COM and .NET domain names. The biggest benefit is of-course that the .BIZ and .INFO domain names are currently more available. i.e. it will be much easier to register an attractive and easy-to-remember domain name for the same price.  Visit: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/ today for more info.
 
Register your domain name today for just $14.95 at: http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/  Registration fees include full access to an easy-to-use control panel to manage your domain name in the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Domain Administrator

207,207,Don't be dumb*!,"

This University Degree Program removes the obstacles that cause adults to abandon all hope. 

You may know employers continually hire, promote and reward raises to new employees.  They may have ZERO skills or experience, but they are continually promoted just because they have this piece of paper.

The degree earned by our students enables them to qualify for career advancement and personal growth.  This acclamation also breaks down the walls that prevents you from receiving the more fulfillment and proper compensation. 

With our service, you are provided with an official graded transcript. Duplicate transcripts will be filed in the graduate's permanent record with our colleges. 

Degree verification and official transcripts will be provided in writing when requested by employers and others authorized by the graduate.

Our College and University transcripts meet the highest academic standards. Our University issues a degree printed on a premium diploma paper, bearing the official gold raised college seal.

Your degree is closer than you think.
No one is turned down.

Confidentiality is assured, and we are awaiting your call today!

208,208,BANNED CD! BANNED CD!,"*****************BANNEDCD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>NET******************

I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

Randy S. Detroit MI 
  
I was in my chiropractor's office when the secretary 
was about to throw out a fax that they had just received. 
The fax was similar to this email and caught my eye. 
I did exactly what it told me to do (a fax blast) and 
in my second day I made $6,000. No hard selling, no 
hustling my friends, just friendly people looking at 
a great opportunity and wanting in. Even if it took 
me a month to make an extra $5,000 I would have been 
happy, but $6,000 in my second day, wow! I'm excited.

222,222,URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE.,"
KEVIN GEORGE

ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE
WEST AFRICA

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and  decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels
in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.

Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next
of kin to my father.

But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a
time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping
me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.
Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684
I remain yours sincerely,

KEVIN GEORGE

We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.

Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!

* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4 – 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.
* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)
* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.

Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time....

**PROSAKA (tm)**
******************

High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living.

This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!
ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.

Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. 

Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) 

Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.

.1. Sponsorship, How and Why? Veuve Clicquot Speaks 
    Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10, 
2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex, 
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy. 
 
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the 
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the 
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer - 
known locally as The English Season. 

Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our 
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these 
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport. 


  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication 
tool?

Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the 
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where 
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We 
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time. 


  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?

We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of 
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and 
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and 
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to 
make The Season central to our marketing mix. 


  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?

We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our 
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the 
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and 
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever 
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.

We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions 
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office will 
like to be involved in such a decision. 


  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?

Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment 
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events. 
This is our rule and frame of investment.


  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?

Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-�-
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press, 
magazine of all kinds). 

Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that 
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of 
similar status, but differing interests. 


  Please describe one of your sponsorships

The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdray 
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by 
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve 
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target 
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the 
king of sports.


  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?

Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large 
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we 
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve 
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are 
getting a good return on our investment.


  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?

<FONT color=""#FFFF00""><B> ""I am astounded! The day before I started taking the GH1, <BR>
I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. <BR>
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. <BR>
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! <BR>
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! <BR>
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. <BR>
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. <BR>
My ""biological"" age is now that of a 40 year old!"" <BR>
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY <BR>
<BR>
""A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood <BR>
pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. <BR>
After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- <BR>
and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!"" <BR>
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA <BR>
<BR>
""After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher <BR>
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision <BR>
were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and <BR>
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill <BR>
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and <BR>
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, <BR>
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra <BR>
karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!"" ""After 6 months on <BR>
GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has <BR>
increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!"" <BR>
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA <BR>
<BR>
""As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute <BR>
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where <BR>
I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again <BR>
after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!"" <BR>
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA <BR>
<BR>
""When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print."" <BR>
-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA <BR>
<BR>
""I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. <BR>
I have been under great stress in my business. <BR>
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping <BR>
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst <BR>
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. <BR>
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. <BR>
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy <BR>
when I go out walking."" <BR>
- Carolyn Munn <BR>
<BR>
""I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that <BR>
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed <BR>
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging <BR>
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. <BR>
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"" <BR>
-Rita Mills McCoy <BR>
<BR>
""I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, <BR>
in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels <BR>
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging <BR>
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal <BR>
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this <BR>
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking <BR>
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! <BR>
-Alan Ross, 43 years old <BR>
<BR>
GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 <BR>
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH. <BR>

<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B> WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B>  <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which <BR>
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the <BR>
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically <BR>
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few <BR>
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones <BR>
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout <BR>
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <BR>
<BR>
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. <BR>
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously <BR>
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original <BR>
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to <BR>
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability <BR>
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. <BR>
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the <BR>
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance <BR>
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <BR>
proper dosage amounts. <BR>
<BR>
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, <BR>
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny <BR>
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate <BR>
the activities of the vital organs. The word ""hormone"" is derived from a Greek word <BR>
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the <BR>
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other <BR>
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly <BR>
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including <BR>
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also <BR>
helps restore hair color and hair loss. <BR>

THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B>  <BR>
<BR>
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production <BR>
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per <BR>
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, <BR>
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians <BR>
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. <BR>
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical <BR>
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been <BR>
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only <BR>
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by <BR>
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. <BR>
</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B> <BR>
GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61</B></FONT>

<FONT face=""MS Sans Serif"">
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B> <BR>
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. <BR>
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. <BR>
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age <BR>
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, <BR>
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages <BR>
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, <BR>
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called <BR>
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. <BR>
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. <BR>
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include <BR>
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.</B></FONT>

236,236,Definitely the answer many have been waiting for!!,"================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

United Kingdom
Tel/Fax: 44-870-136-7079

Date: 09/11/2002 

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  

Yours Faithfully,
Capt JOHN OKELE

255,255,your help,"DEAR SIR,

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.

No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.

Best personal regards,

MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

257,257,Your First 100 Free Minutes of Long Distance! Your First 100 Free    Minutes of Long Distance!,"
Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.  

Opex's usual rates are 4.5 cents per minute for domestic calls, with great international rates, too!

260,260,urgent and confidential business proposal,"Your Attention, Please

PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO:

(1)  abacha10@africamail.net
(2)  abacha10@mail2africa.com  
(3)  alhajiabubakar10@email.com
 

I  have very confidential and urgent business to
transact with you. But first permit me to say that I
do not know you; you are receiving this mail via blind
carbon copy of email addresses which I obtained from a
simple internet search. You are therefore NOT obliged
to reply. However, if you do, and the conditions are
right, you will be amply compensated. It is also
pertinent to add that I am using an assumed name, and
free web based email addresses for my personal
protection .
 
In order to give you a background of this ""business
transaction"", please check the website  

http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3PQPP45QC

Before proceeding further, please permit me to give
you more background on the Abacha family ""MILLIONS"" as
it is now known; please check the following websites
 
http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/aug98/17_29_059.html

http://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&ContentID=974

I have taken some pains to give you readings on the
Abacha Family fortunes; They are of  course a matter
of public record, and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES INDEED THAT
GENERAL SANI ABACHA TRANSFERRED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
OUT OF NIGERIA ! However, it is conceivable and even
logical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN
""DISCOVERED"" OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IN
SYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT
OF NIGERIA. AND THIS IS A FACT!

The truth of the matter is that much more of the
Abacha fortunes are still hidden , their location a
closely guarded secret; Her Excellency, Hajia
Abacha,widow of Gen. Sani Abacha, ex-head of
State of Nigeria, who died June 8, 1998
and her immediate family are under house arrest in
Nigeria. It is therefore my job to search out a
reliable person, a complete stranger to help
transfer/secure a negotiated amount from the still
hidden millions of Dollars.  The right person must
pass a background check in order to avoid my being
betrayed to the AUTHORITIES, as happened in the past.
It is now obvious why I will be using an assumed name
for the moment. All precautions will be taken to avoid
leakages. Though I am using the internet which is
largely unsafe, as soon as I get a ""reliable""
candidate, I will introduce security measures for
every body's protection. For the moment I am simply a
""Contact Person"" for the REAL Abacha family.

In sum, the person I am looking for is an individual
or corporate body that is able to provide one or more
Bank Accounts into which arrangements will be made to
transfer US$5,000,000.00 to US$10,000,000.00 every
week; The routine, periodic transfers in small
instalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in
the wrong quarters. These transfers will be secure and
properly legal, and with all proper bank
documentation. The right person may need to establish 
fresh/new RECEIVING BANK accounts free from legal or
financial encumbrances. Persons with bad credit rating
, undischarged bankrupts, companies in receivership
and minors need not reply; Because of the stature and
confidentiality of this proposed transaction, a
successful candidate will receive 25% of all
transfers. Other Conditions, including maximum secrecy
and confidentiality  apply. 

If you are interested in helping this family, and if
you can meet our strict conditions, please reply to
all email addresses listed below. In your reply please
include your phone, fax and contact address. In the
event you do not meet our conditions after a brief
back ground check, you will be communicated
accordingly. Please before replying,  take your time
to go through all the links and investigate thoroughly
all the foregoing; this is a serious proposal, despite
the medium in which you are receiving my message.

Looking forward to your reply,

Yours Sincerely,

Alhaji Abubakar

Здравствуйте!

Среди компаний, покидающих российский рынок, оказались и те, что предоставляли услугу дополнительного фактора аутентификации и отправки одноразовых SMS-кодов.

Это означает проблемы с входом в системы, предоставлением доступа сотрудникам и подрядчикам, снижение уровня защищенности, рост нагрузки на отделы технической поддержки и сопутствующие проблемы.

Если вы или ваши клиенты столкнулись с такой проблемой, предлагаем рассмотреть российскую систему для двухфакторной аутентификации от компании Мультифактор.



Мультифактор может заменить:

  *   Microsoft Azure MFA
  *   Duo Security (Cisco)
  *   SafeNet Trusted Access (STA)
  *   SafeNet Private Cloud Edition (PCE)
  *   ESET Secure Authentication (ESA)
  *   Gemalto MFA



Что такое Мультифактор?

Это услуга дополнительного фактора для аутентификации сотрудников и подрядчиков в ваших системах в дополнение к имени пользователя и паролю

Поддерживается широкий набор методов аутентификации:

  *   Биометрия (Face ID, отпечаток пальца, сетчатка глаза)
  *   Приложение Multifactor
  *   Телеграмм
  *   OTP/U2F - аппаратные ключи
  *   Google Authenticator / Яндекс Ключ
  *   SMS
  *   Звонок

Вы можете добавить дополнительный фактор для доступа к практически любой системе с минимальным обучением сотрудников.

Сервис размещен в сертифицированном ЦОД в России, а доставка кодов и команд для аутентификации происходит по территории страны.



Почему Мультифактор?

  *   Полностью российское решение, есть в реестре отечественного ПО
  *   Интегрируется практически с любой системой
  *   Техническая поддержка 24\7 на русском языке
  *   Решение Мультифактор в среднем 4 раза дешевле аналогов

В условиях, когда пароли сливаются каждый день, а количество атак на российские сервера значительно возросло, использование дополнителього фактора для входа в системы - необходимость.



Просто напишите в ответ на это письмо, и наши специалисты покажут решение живьем, помогут с пробным подключением к услуге и составлением плана пилота и интеграции.

Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time! 
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!! 

The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers! 

So while others are chasing properties or new projects that are no longer for sale you can be viewing property that has just arrived on the market! 

Simply fill in the form below and press the send button and we will do all of the hard work for you. 

Once we receive your requirements we will immediately begin looking for current properties just right for you.

271,271,Earn $300-$1000 A Week From Your Home!............,"
HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLY

Simple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,

Ron M. Jenkins
Home-Mailing Division Manager

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!

  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

275,275,Lowest possible interest rate for you--GUARANTEED.,"Some opportunities only come around every 30
years or so. This is one of those. Why?

Because interest rates are definitely rising.

Have you locked in the lowest rate (in THREE
DECADES yet!) for your present mortgage?

Rates haven't been this low in almost 3 decades.
They may well never be this low again--ever. If
you haven't taken this opportunity to secure the
best possible rate on your home loan, you're
simply letting money slip through your fingers.

At a few special times, it is SO easy to save
""big bucks""...and this is one of those times. Why
continue to pay more than is necessary and
continue to let future savings slip away?
  
We're a national mortgage provider. We're NOT a
broker. As such, we can guarantee you the lowest
possible rate and the best possible deal but only
if you act NOW.
 
There is no charge, cost or obligation to see if
this opportunity meets your needs. You can easily
determine if a new loan makes sense for you, and
exactly why, because we provide only ""easy to
understand"" quotes (in ""layman's terms"", in other
words).
 
We offer primary and secondary home loans and we
will be happy to show you in ""black and white""
why your existing loan is the best for you or why
you should replace it. Of course, there's no cost
to you at all to share your time with us. None. 

Take 2 minutes and use the link below that works
best for you. For 2 minutes of your time, we'll
show you how you can save you and your family
""big bucks"" today. This is a once-every-30-years
opportunity. So don't delay and ""miss the boat"".
Act now.

charge of managing and supervising  the disbursement of oil sales revenues
for the Nigerian government.The revenues  under our control runs into
several hundred of millions of dollars monthly.My self and   
other colleagues in the NDDC are currently in need of a foreign partner
with whose bank account we shall transfer the sum of Forty Nine Million
Five Hundred Thosand United States Dollars($49.5m).This fund accrued to us
as commission for oil sales contracts handled under our supervision.

The fund is presently waiting in the Government Account named CBN/FGN
INDEPENDENT REVENUE account number 400-939134 with J.P.MORGAN CHASE
BANK,New York.You can do your independent verification of this. However,
by virtue of our  position as civil servants and members of the NDDC, we
cannot acquire this funds in our name. This is because as top civil
servants, we are not allowed by law of the land to own or operate bank
accounts outside our country for now.

to look for an overseas partner in whose account we would
transfer the fund

What a sad world it is where money is spent on 
weapons instead of books, on war instead of 
health, corporations instead of human beings.
",1
298,298,"A little Investment, Will  make you plenty 92-2","Dear Future Millionaire:

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - Follow
what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, who is President, or whether you keep
your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I
never responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said ""you throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2
hours with your wife"". ""What the heck."" Believe me, no matter
where you believe ""those feelings"" come from, I thank goodness
every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would
be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on.  It's true. Every
word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your
home.

THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news
program recently devoted entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make people
money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was
legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program
and if people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are bound
to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE
TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY   WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable
opportunity"". I was approached many times before but each time I
passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one
could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks,
with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""this program has been around for a long time but I
never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in
the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to
come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months
after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8
months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00
and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is
to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More
testimonials later but first:


=========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months
easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT
AGAIN and AGAIN !!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name
appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail
problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5
REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your
computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way
other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or
you will loose out on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not
work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and
if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put
their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get
all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try
to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you
do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the
reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and
you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.

1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This
is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data.
To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:



 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it
goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive
only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much
better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000
each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000
e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a
total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded
with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.


Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for
Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for
Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is
100,000 orders for Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million
dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 +
3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand
Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen
if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people
on the Internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more
coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads
on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go
along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them
the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise
until they receive the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or
credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is
simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted.
Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the
NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within
2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did
not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

**Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in
front of a Different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME
SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this
business !!! =================================================

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for
the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly
well as it is now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have
put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2
....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to
may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on
every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the
more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have
given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to
become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============

'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am
an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty
good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting
my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I
''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told
you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was
on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all
cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
 Mitchell  Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois
=================================================


'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make
up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am,
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size
post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the
first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does
not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better
investment with a faster return and so big''.  Dan Sondstrom,
Alberta, Canada 
=================================================
'' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within
22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money
with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions
carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My
first month I made $ 20, 560.00 and by the end of third month my
total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to
internet''. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

305,305,REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.,"OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE,
FALOMO, IKOYI.
LAGOS - NIGERIA.


YOUR KIND ATTN.,



RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.

I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.

The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.

I remain most obliged.

Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates

internet. In case you're back on the market, you should check
out this new web service that instantly posts your resume to
over 75 career websites.

You fill out one online form and immediately you can be seen
by over 1.5 million employers and recruiters daily! It works.

In about 15 minutes you'll be posted to all the major sites

It's a tough job market right now. So if you've got a good
job hold on to it. But these days it's smart to have a few
irons in the fire too. That only happens by being in all the
right places at all the right times. So even if you do it by
hand, get maximum exposure and be found on as many career

Just food for thought!

317,317,[ILUG-Social] HELLO,"OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
IKOYI-LAGOS.

ATTN:,                  

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.

Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 

Yours faithfully,

Egnr. Femi Daniel.

NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin tocome

from his account unless someone applies for claims asthe next  of kin to the

their
family member nor distant relative hasappeared to claim the said fund.  Upon
this discovery, I and other officialsin my department have agreed to make
business with you release the totalamount into your account as the heir of
the
fund since no one came forit or discovered either maintained account with
our
bank, other wisethe fund will be returned to the bank treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 30%for
you as
foreign partner and 70% for us the officials in my department.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, my colleague and I
willcome to
your country and mind our share. It is from our 60% we intendto import
computer
accessories into my country as way of recycling thefund.  To commence this
transaction we require you to immediately indicateyour interest by calling
me
or sending me a fax immediately on the aboveTelefax # and enclose your
private
contact Telephone #, Fax #, full nameand address and your designated

 ordinates to enable us fileletter of  claim to the appropriate department

DEAR SIR, 
  
I AM MR.

DEPARTMENT OF ABSA BANK LIMITED. IN MY DEPARTMENT, WE DISCOVERED AN 
ABANDONED SUM OF US$12.5,000,000 (Twelve POINT FIVE MILLION US 
DOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO 
DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE 
CRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 
HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN, OR RELATION TO 
THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, 
NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS MONEY. 
  
IT IS BASED ON THIS THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTEMENT AND I HAVE

TREASURY ACCOUNT. 
  
NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO 
THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 
2002. THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF-KIN 
IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE DECEASED (CUSTOMER) WAS A

Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home? A one time
investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars let's get you on the road to financial success.
 
ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
===========================================
BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet,
a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation
of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The
show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting
the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions,
they are bound to make some mega bucks with only$25 out of pocket cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
 
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached
many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my
astonishment, I received a total of $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.
""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
============================================
 
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never
believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble
my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and voila ..... 3 weeks later the money
started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that
I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program,
I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''
More testimonials later but first,

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably,
please read the following.................THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU
ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears
ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will
need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to
the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports
and keep them on your desk in case something happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report,
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step
'' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way
this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method
has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work
this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the
       name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
       the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands
of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
 
============================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and
those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%.
Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that
is only 10 orders for report # 1.  
 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2%
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out.
The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4. Those 10,000 people send out
5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that
is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. 
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
           Your total income in this example is:
 
                  1..... $50 +
                  2..... $500 +
                  3..... $5,000 +
                  4..... $50,000 +
                  5..... $500,000
                  Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE IT OUT!
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE
IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
 
============================================
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over
150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 
============================================
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive,
all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service
on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.
 
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ============
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper,
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.

======== MORE TESTIMONIALS ============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major
U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge
of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless
fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work.
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have
joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois
==========================================
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate
in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that
there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''.
'' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so
big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
===========================================
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given
it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was
e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did
not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within
22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
============================================
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed
the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first
month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanks to the internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

342,342,Earn 100.000$ in one year working at home,"Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

352,352,your help,"DEAR SIR,

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.

No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.

Best personal regards,

MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

FROM:MR. DESMOND STEVENS

                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. 
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. 
BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHER�S MONEY TO 
 A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 
AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE
  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
PLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. 
YOURS FAITHFULLY, 
DESMOND STEVENS.

========================================================
Net Neutrality and the eBay Community: A Call to Action
========================================================

Dear jnazario,

As you know, I almost never reach out to you personally with a request to get involved in a debate in the U.S. Congress. However, today I feel I must.

Right now, the telephone and cable companies in control of Internet access are trying to use their enormous political muscle to dramatically change the Internet. It might be hard to believe, but lawmakers in Washington are seriously debating whether consumers should be free to use the Internet as they want in the future.

Join me by clicking here -- http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092 -- to send a message to your representatives in Congress.

The phone and cable companies now control more than 95% of all Internet access. These large corporations are spending millions of dollars to promote legislation that would allow them to divide the Internet into a two-tiered system.

The top tier would be a ""Pay-to-Play"" high-speed toll-road restricted to only the largest companies that can afford to pay high fees for preferential access to the Net.

The bottom tier -- the slow lane -- would be what is left for everyone else. If the fast lane is the information ""super-highway,"" the slow lane will operate more like a dirt road.

Today's Internet is an incredible open marketplace for goods, services, information and ideas. We can't give that up. A two-lane system will restrict innovation because start-ups and small companies -- the companies that can't afford the high fees -- will be unable to succeed, and we'll lose out on the jobs, creativity and inspiration that come with them.

The power belongs with Internet users, not the big phone and cable companies. Let's use that power to send as many messages as possible to our elected officials in Washington. Please join me by clicking here right now to send a message to your representatives in Congress before it is too late. You can make the difference.
==> http://click2.ebay.com/705443.465060.0.68092

Thank you for reading this note. I hope you'll make your voice heard today.

Meg Whitman

374,374,[ILUG] Earn 100.000$ in one year working at home,"Hello

You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!

With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 

I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""

==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. 

Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.

Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?

There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.

** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!
=================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. 

Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 

Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""

Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 

The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""

Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

376,376,Time Travelers PLEASE HELP!!!,"If you are a time traveler or alien disguised as human and or have
the technology to travel physically through time I need your help!

My life has been severely tampered with and cursed!!
I have suffered tremendously and am now dying!

I need to be able to:

Travel back in time.

Rewind my life including my age back to 4.

I am in very great danger and need this immediately!

I am aware of two types of time travel one in physical form and 
the other
in energy form where a snapshot of your brain is taken using 
either the
dimensional warp or the carbon copy replica device and then sends 
your consciousness
back through time to part with your younger self. Please explain
how safe and what your method involves.

I have a time machine now, but it has limited abilitys and is 
useless
without
a vortex.

If you can provide information on how to create vortex generator 
or
where I can get some of the blue glowing moon crystals this would 
also
be helpful. I am however concerned with the high level of 
radiation these
crystals give off, if  you could provide a shielding that would be 
great.
I believe the vortex needs to be east-west polarized,
North-south polarized vortexexs are used for cross-dimensional 
time 
travel only.


Only if you have this technology and can help me exactly as 
mentioned
please send me a (SEPARATE) email to: IneedTimeTravel@aol.com

Please do not reply if your an evil alien!
Thanks

379,379,[ILUG-Social] URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDED,"Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

387,387,Ground breaking post card creates annuity leads," Generate your own leads using ground-breaking Roth conversion
postcards.	
 	
  _____  

Every senior wants to hear about the roth conversion if you can
eliminate the up front tax cost. You can with the new and improved roth
conversion program from GSL Advisory. 

The cheapest and most successful way to generate roth conversion program
leads is to send postcards while also placing an ad in the small local
paper. Repeat the ads and the postcard mailing at least 6 different
times.

The one truth in advertising is that repetition works. Even the smallest
and most unassuming ad works if it is seen several times. See if you can
find an area that has its own zip code and a local paper serving that
area. Some retirement communities have both a newspaper and their own
zip code.

This is your gold mine.

To see the postcard and ad and to learn how to work the system, complete
the form below which will direct you to the post card and how to make it
work for you.

Dear Sir.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.

I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.

We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 

If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.

Yours faithfully,

DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

403,403,SPS se odrekao Slobodana Milosevica,"
       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

415,415,URGENT ASSISTANCE(CONFIDENTIAL),"Dear sir,,


My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo
Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South
African Information exchange Johannesburg.
.

Due to the previous war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters
to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman
behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our
country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the
presidnt MUGABE. The president�s supporters invaded my
father�s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested
him and confiscated all his investment.

Early last year when this victimization of white
farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father
envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all
his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of
Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.
When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a
private security company through the help of his
lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real
contents of the box to the security company, then,
went back home. He registered the box as family
treasure.

While he was still in detention that led to his death
due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South
Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in
Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He
was arrested on the 5th of March last year.
Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of
December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.

Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and
depressing because my father�s lawyer is presently
hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;
though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I
want to relocate to your country for good. Presently,
my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum
permit as a refugee.

I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the
money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of
this country to your country for investment. If you
think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with
me immediately with the  number below . Your
compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated
if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my
country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep
this information to yourself and secret, because I
wouldn�t want anything that will expose me, and the
existence of this money.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

STEVEN DUBA (DR).

419,419,Turn $5 into $20k- ( Pay Pal ) vdbs,"THIS E-MAIL AD IS BEING SENT IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. SENATE BILL 1618, TITLE #3, SECTION 301

TO REMOVE YOURSELF SEND A BLANK E-MAIL TO:removal992002@yahoo.com

Hi,

You most likely have seen or heard about 
""The Letter"" $5.00 Paypal Program"" that has been seen lately 
on 20/20 and OPRAH WINFREY...etc... How would you like 
to generate more income through a different avenue? What 
if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another 
program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 
There 
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!

THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH 
YOU 
IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!

Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest
to you! Please read all of this. This is not something 
that I would normally look at, except that I read an 
article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about 
PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it 
would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had
already experienced their efficiency and good standing. 
You can complete this whole process in one hour and you 
will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! 
Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the 
Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on the
Internet by E-mail.

NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from
individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a 
little of their time.

TESTIMONIALS FROM:

Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:
Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of
our frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 
grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run 
this program again........

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to
you... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said 
and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was 
up to over $12,000! I owe you!

GETTING STARTED.

If you're not already a user, the very first thing you
need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes 
and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this 
program FREE!

Here's the link:

https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com

BE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO 
$100 
DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!

Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) 
to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note
like ""Please add me to your mailing list."" BE PREPARED TO GET
EXCITED.... YOU 
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the 
others 
to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No 
printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US 
Postal and 
Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, 
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal 
Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a 
product or service must be exchanged for money received). 

Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this 
THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much
faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY 
HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see 
results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT 
MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). Ideally, you should
send them to people who send their programs to you or to 
personal contacts who are already working on the web, 
because they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! Besides, this program is 
MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already 
in 
another program, stay with it, but do
yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! 

It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long 
before others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE 
person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET 
WHEN 
YOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have 
a 
PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 
GIFT 
to
the person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list 
at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow 
the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 
in your bank account!

Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT 
POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 
transaction that you get from PayPal!!!

Follow These Simple Instructions: 

E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST 
name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying 
""subscribe me to your mailing list"". Only the first 
person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. 

Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the 
other 
two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first 
place 
in order to earn money fast! 
If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-
mail to then your name will be immediately removed
from the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if 
you add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of 
people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! 

NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in 
the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. 
Send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.

ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the 
response 
time is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! 

Consider this! Millions of people surf the Internet
everyday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people 
to start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move 
the other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own 
e-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is 
associated 
with your PayPal account.

*************************************

There are fifty thousand new people who get on the
Internet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses 
is the people who send you offers by email.
The source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to
think of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I 
say 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's 
so easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!
To send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE
and paste it in the message of your E-mail. 

TO DO THIS:
1. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and ""select all""
2. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and select ""copy""
3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure
it's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)
4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box
5. Go to ""edit"" and ""paste"" (Then you can format it
anyway you want!)


Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the
top name, adding your name and address to the bottom 
of the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, 
YOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT 
forget 
to send $5.00 via PayPal (along 
with your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL
address before deleting it!

NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in
this e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal 
referring URL;


https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com


THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.
When your name reaches the first position in a few
days, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!
The money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people
like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to 
receive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a 
total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) 
in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is 
real money that you can spend on anything you wish!
Just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it 
directly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that 
easy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?

GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?

IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF
COURSE YOU CAN---

This plan is structured for everyone to send only 20
letters each. However, you are certainly not limited 
to 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters 
you send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can 
E-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! 
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run 
this 
program, just follow steps 1
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! 
Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no 
mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the 
printer or copier, and you can do it again and again 
with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up 
a new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the 
list. This is proof that you paid to get put on the 
list which is the service rendered to make all this 
legal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive 
an MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will 
climb to the number one position at dizzying rates. 
Follow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE 
PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. 
Your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list 
WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats 
the other people who have worked hard and have earned the 
right to be there. So please, play by the rules and the 
$$$ will come to you!
$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will 
prosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, 
especially with all the different programs out there 
on the web, but if you don't try this you will 
never know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!
I've been watching this type of program for years and
this is about as easy and fast as you can get it and 
it can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, 
no envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort 
and faith!!! This program really ""Keeps It Short and Simple""! 

OH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link 
under your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...
so they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when 
someone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! 
Let's all make some serious money 
$$$$$$

Play by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but your
time, and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS.


FOLLOWING ARE SOME NOTES ABOUT PayPal WHICH YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL:PayPal 
lets 
you pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's No.1 online 
payment 
service - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay T auctions and thousands 
and 
thousands of online shops. You can also use PayPal to 
pay your friends - example; it's a convenient way to 
split the phone bill with your roommate, send cash to your kids in 
college,or 
send cash to someone in another country. Better yet, you can also 
earn $5 while you do it. Each time someone signs up for an account and 
completes the Refer-a-Friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 BONUS! 
When 
you send money through Pay Pal, you can fund your payments with your 
credit 
card or checking account. You won't have to worry about your privacy, 
because 
PayPal keeps your accounting information safe. Making a purchase with 
PayPal 
is more secure than mailing a check or giving your credit card number to 
a 
stranger. That's why over 9 million people from around the world use 
PayPal 
to move money.
Signing up for a PayPal account is easy. It takes only
a couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus 
requirements PayPal will automatically add $5 to your 
account balance. To learn more about PayPal visit the 
web site at

https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com

""Best of the Web"" -Forbes
""Using the service is actually safer than a check or
money order""- Wall Street Journal


""PayPal can play a major role in your life. You can
use it to pay for stuff at auction sites, settle 
dinner debts with friends or nudge your cousin to 
repay that $50 he borrowed at the family reunion.- Time


PS. Does this sound too good? Well maybe to some skeptics it

Sure.  But for most people, changing their company's or ISP's server
requires years of lobbying, while they have total and immediate

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.

Probably not.   Next time try clicking on the folder name in the

be the one displayed in the FTOC.   If the sequence doesn't exist,

Perhaps it would be nicer if flist would do it as well, but this

Hi Vipul,

I reckon if the ""unwritable log file"" error condition could be caught by
Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a
great help.

As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die'
error in perl).

The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being 
issued by exmh is that selects and inserts the sig and bind that to a 
key sequence.  That shouldn't be *too* difficult, it's just a matter 
of figuring out the tcl (something my perl-based brain isn't excited

That depends on how the list is collected, or
even on what the senders say about how the list

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

Yes, I will, sometime, after I look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break, and why.

But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.

Patch follows ...

I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH).   But since
I stopped doing that, the variable ""msgs"" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   This is just a
frill though, so I didn't change that.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...

Lennon killer seeks parole again

The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.

Date: 2002-10-03T14:42:29-05:00

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. &#8220;Microsoft has redesigned. 
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; 

The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. 

Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. 

Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. Want to find the search box? That's &#8220;1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans 
dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot 
gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif 
...&#8221; And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home 
page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).

Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

Please don't misquote me.  I did not assert that you ""can't track
spammers"".  Here is what I said:

| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in
| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good
| example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.

I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam.

I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score.  I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.

I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive
score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's
inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can
increase the magnitude of the score.

29,29,[zzzzteana] Punch bags filled with incontinence pads,"

http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633932.Bizarre+London.0.html

An investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.

Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.

Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.

The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.

So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.

Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.

""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""

This ""more sophisticated than [Napster or Freenet]"" part seems
to be the same behavior implemented in many other P2P CDNs, 
such as:

  - Kazaa
  - EDonkey/Overnet
  - BitTorrent
  - Gnutella (with HUGE extensions)

------- Additional Comments From jm@jmason.org  2002-10-03 13:29 -------
1. Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.

2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in
the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not
know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5
for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So
we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's
the problem!

3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.

I think I might be missing some details of what you're peeved about,
though... could you elaborate specifically?

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.

I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at:

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630.spec

Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these

39,39,on's Sept 11 message in the National Review,"
http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.asp


September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
The Wages of September 11
There is no going back.



September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
because the sun still rises and sets.

This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real
time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.

Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
ghoulish not fearsome.

The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate
them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
paradise on earth.

Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters 
a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
hobbits after September 11.

America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more
friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a
pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come
from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal
family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.

The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand
brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in
sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.

Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
thousands in high-rises.

Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.

No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.

All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.

Too early IMO (if you mean to leave the various other tools out of
it).  If and when we package this, perhaps we should use Barry's trick
from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir
of the distribution (rather than requiring an extra directory level
just so the package can be a subdir of the distro).

42,42,Government plans to hand out free Valium,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85521686
Date: Not supplied

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium. 
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a 
free dose. Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of 
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for 
that. 

    The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm 
    people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations 
    where lethal weapons are inappropriate.

43,43,[Spambayes] Deployment,"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)

My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.

Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's

IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.

Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

Brothel duty for Australian MP

A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to 
spend the day as a ""slave"" at one of Western Australia's most 
notorious brothels. 

Liberal Party member Barry Haase was ""won"" in a charity auction 
after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of 
Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. 

[...]

""I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what 
Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his 
political career to make informed decisions that he might not 
have been able to make before,"" Ms Kenworthy said. 

Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party 
seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. 

""You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant 
charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game,"" he said.

I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
from making money on advertisements that are deemed
thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
government board.  As it was posted to ""discussion"" I
thought there'd be some.

Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill
lamenting the fact that some people know how to
fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously
he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups
get specific ""zones"" and that it's not up to the
police to decide what messages and signs get put into
what zones to most expediently keep order.  

The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
political rallies that you don't agree with has become
common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
They teach you that your very first year of law school.

I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. 

I think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school
as obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics
class or else they didn't teach civics in mini-guantanamo, OH
65 years ago.

52,52,Pluck and Luck,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at
part of the equation.

America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is
a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There
is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the
right time, to go that high.

Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is
involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.
Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.
Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.

Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the
rest of us who tend to sort.

There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the
first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree
at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits
of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.

And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity
of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most
people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better
if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the
Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'
is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.

Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far
more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.
Superior performance, often not.

I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now.  If I were tagging To:
addresses, for example, the tokens would look like

    'to:email addr:mit'

instead of

    'email addr:mit'

as they appear when an email-like thingie is found in the body.  Whether
email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now
is something I haven't tested.

I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably 6 months or more, so I
could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.

What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.

The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.

And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.

Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.

The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.

So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't

66,66,[SAdev] [Bug 1054] New: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS,"http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1054

           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: P2
         Component: Rules
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Here is what I got:

OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME
  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)
100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)
  1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6
  0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5
  4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4
  3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3
  8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2
  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

  7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

and my stats:

 19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

spamc will skip every file bigger than 250k on it's own. It's got the 
command line switch -s to change this value. But it doesn't hurt of course 
to use the procmail limit.

68,68,Dan Gillmor responds to Jack Valenti,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85506950
Date: Not supplied

Dan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This 
week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda 
really entails: 

    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another 
    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 
    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 
    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights. 

    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 
    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 
    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 
    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. 
    Saying it doesn't make it so.

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.

... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.

AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.

Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)

In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  

People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
clunky interface.

Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop?

Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:

Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Great Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite 
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which 
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, 
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars. 

    A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy 
    treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox, 
    whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T. 
    Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone 
    (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to 
    make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro 
    Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined 
    piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head; 
    giant's rings...

Well, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of
shady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to
suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least
development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few
server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had
no problems with great performance.

Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad""
programming language or application platform?  You don't think this has
anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS has
basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?
Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the
right way to go for most high level applications?

Hmmm again.... You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took
you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak?  I am
not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really
good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory
management, however occasional they may be.

Wow!  So you're telling me that unless the application involves
bit-counting, it's trivial?  What about the application itself?  What about
high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.?  Aren't most
high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?
Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?  For
example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks
(there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating
system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?

I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the
case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large
applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more
than three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get the
programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  With
Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in
a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database
(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).

YIKES!  Have you written db code with C/C++ for different databases (just an
example)?  Tried porting a persistence layer from Windows to Unix?  Say you
have Informix running on Solaris and you want to port to Windows with MS SQL
(bad idea...but for the sake of the example), would you rather deal with
JDBC port or C/C++ port that uses Informix drivers and now you have to use
ODBC?

So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for
everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way of
dealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,
database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there is
one accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim
ignorance...

Not suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is
overkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace
to programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no
flame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious
discussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every ""Kid""
can write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don't understand
various design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually
tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and
reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++
than in Java due to existence of standard API's.

88,88,Ringing bell on other computer,"
Hi,

succeeded in ringing a bell anytime I get a mail
to my inbox (Not Mailing lists, spams etc.) by
using procmail to execute a ""play clink.wav"" on
the ""right"" mails.
Now my demands are growing ;-)
I use my laptop remotely very often and now I would
like the bell to sound on that when I am there.
I triedto use the KDE remote sound server and it works in
the tests, but when procmail runs it it doesn't, presumably
as it doesn't have the authorization to communicate with
the laptop, beeing another user?

Any hints.

Can you submit this to bugzilla?  It definately is a bug, I mean I do
a packet trace and here's what I get with one of my spams:

So spamd is definately returning false incorrectly.

Hm, it is built inside the same chroot.  aviplay works (well it would if I 
had XV, I get X errors ;)).  But it doesn't complain about linker 
problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok.

Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects - 
naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of 
libraries, API stability, ...

Yup, tagging data is mondo tedious, and mistakes hurt.

I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand
grepping.  Be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of
there.

With probabilities favoring ham or spam?  A skip token is produced in lieu
of ""word"" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters.  It's
possible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.
However, if you're running current CVS, Tokenizer/retain_pure_html_tags
defaults to False now, so HTML decorations should vanish before body
tokenization.

Because I get mail through several different email addresses, I frequently
get duplicates (or triplicates or more-plicates) of various spam messages.
In saving spam for later analysis I haven't always been careful to avoid
saving such duplicates.

I wrote a script some time ago to try an minimize the duplicates I see by
calculating a loose checksum, but I still have some duplicates.  Should I
delete the duplicates before training or not?  Would people be interested in
the script?  I'd be happy to extricate it from my local modules and check it

You choose to have your email client do that.  You don't have to.  Short
of Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including
reading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise.

An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  
If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the
line before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffer
sniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.

The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --
maybe -- Palladium.

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

105,105,[SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?,"Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.

Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the
vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I
can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers
down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of
the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of
the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for
the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,
these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not
secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole
business is about finding them and putting them out of business

Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)
in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business
plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't
understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be
unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the
potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the
Habeas warrant mark.

Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on
your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only
license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on
the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove
us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it
has a chance to show any promise.

At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it
encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those
without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the
transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't
steal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.

Haha!!!

Just a few notes:

 - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone
   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.

 - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!

 - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.

 - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.

107,107,The Curse of India's Socialism,"I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to
just doing

	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results

seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via ""busy"")

Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).

How about enabling the ""Show unseen message count in folder cache""

(if greater than 0), so you don't really need the unseen window unless
you're using more sequences than just ""unseen"".

120,120,[zzzzteana] Worryingly sophisticated bees,"Ananova:  
Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'

Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)

I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
got around to making them spamtraps.

So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
the majority of them don't work.

If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
because again it's easy to trace you.

So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.

Everyone else doesn't really care.


That's my view anyway. :)

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.

If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.

Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through??

124,124,More fun with the PTC,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428
Date: Not supplied

I received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.

Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.

It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.

The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.

Forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job. I tracked them
down, they dont exist anymore, like 99% of the things I track down the req's
are pulled or there is a freeze.

The real problem is you cant even train for jobs now, since they _demand_
7-10 years at a job paid to do the wierd collection of skills they want.

But I'll get lucky eventually and someone I know will be a hiring manager.

A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. 

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" 

Mom fainted.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

RAH

It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost
is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people
streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage
the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.

The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.
Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title
(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there
are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in
for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get
all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and
nearly impossible...

We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -
which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have
serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people
webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play
on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to
those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it
is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(

Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. 

Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.

You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".

Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.

Subject: liberal defnitions


Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.

As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.

Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.

And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

Look for ""Zygalski sheets"".

By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up
being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had
mock Enigmas which cycled through the
Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a
quarter of an hour, but the Germans
started using a plugboard which then
had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities.  The
Poles noticed that there were some
patterns in the messages which were
only possible via certain plugboard
settings, and so:

> When we have collected several such cards corresponding to different
> initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares
> corresponding to the same daily settings are aligned and shine a
> light beneath the pile.  Only those squares which let the light
> through will correspond to possible daily settings.

So the brute force hardware allowed
precalculation of ""optical"" computing
devices which then narrowed down the
possibilities enough for brute force
to again be used for daily decodes,
until:

Amavisd or Amavisd-new? If the latter, you don't need spamd running, since
amavisd-new calls SA functions directly.

Article about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter

    Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. ""The little 
    girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not 
    getting refunds she took it out on the little girl."" 

I don't know anything about the Irish Travelers, but I'm wondering if they are

I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.

The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).

Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.

That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.

Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).

kre

ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates.

Just a big *thank you* to Chris for being willing to dive in and get

When this stabilizes, it will be a great excuse for a 2.6 release.

162,162,rd industry defends practices to Senate,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221
Date: Not supplied

The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 

    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

I'm not sure what you're doing, but suspect you're storing individual
WordInfo pickles.  If so, most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to
that, and doesn't happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance
directly.

I'm not interested in optimizing anything yet, and get many benefits from
the *ease* of working with utterly vanilla Python instance objects.  Lots of
code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes.  Very few
people have tried this code yet, and there are still many questions about it
(see, e.g., Jeremy's writeup of his disappointing first-time experiences
today).  Let's keep it as easy as possible to modify for now.  If you're
desparate to save memory, write a subclass?

Other people are free to vote in other directions, of course <wink>.

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.

Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the ""Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking"" book
every Java programmer learned from.

tokenize() couldn't be easier to use:  it takes a string argument, and
produces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or
tuple, or ... doesn't matter).  All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py
and timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.

Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would
do any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.
That's a research issue on which no work has been done.

That's partly a failure of imagination <wink>.  Splitting out all knowledge
of tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.
Change the

    from timtoken import tokenize

at the top to use any other tokenizer now.  If you want to make it easier
still, feel free to check in something better.

The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it's
hard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of
different physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various
formats, one file per ""folder"", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,
...).  If you're a Python coder <wink>, you *should* find it very easy to
change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.
Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.

This sounds like a bottomless pit to me, and there's no easier way to
customize than to edit the code.  As README.txt still says, though, massive
refactoring would help.  Hop to it!

 Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties
 By Roger Boyes
 
 
 
 MANAGERS of Germanys political parties are having difficulty explaining their
 enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed
 largely from Mein Kampf, Hitlers personal manifesto. The incident illustrates
 how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an
 election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to
 those of the Führer. 
 
 Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the
 present Chancellor, said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union
 headquarters in Ingolstadt. Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the
 flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland, said the letter,
 signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. 
 
 The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. Many thanks for your nice
 thoughts, replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for
 membership. 
 
 The letter used chunks of Hitlers book, which is still banned in Germany.
 History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.
 
 
 The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of
 existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,
 the letter-writer said. So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March
 sun. Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler
 was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. 
 
 Similar letters, also using the Nazi leaders words, were sent to the other
 political parties and drew sympathetic responses. I read your letter with
 great interest and pleasure, the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in
 Cologne, said. 
 
 Great that you want to join us! enthused the Green Party headquarters. The
 Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball
 at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the
 star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by
 Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. 
 
 I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing
 extremism, said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist
 Rainer Popp. I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. 
 
 For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special
 Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called  with packets of
 election material from zealous political headquarters, Herr Popp said. 
 
 I was stunned that political parties could react in this way  I reckon I
 would have had the same response if I had signed the letter Adolf Hitler.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

http://belps.freewebsites.com/

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

Tuesday, 27 August, 2002, 21:35 GMT 22:35 UK
Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure

Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

It doesn't need to as Red Hat Linux already sets correct permissions on all
ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms
file) and the modules.conf files takes care of loading the right modules on
demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work
for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the
computer is halted, even using ALSA.

I'm glad you got your card working with these! I'm now wondering if I won't
maybe buy an amplifier that supports Dolby Digial decoding (my current one
""only"" does PRo Logic) since I've read that ALSA supports the S/PDIF
optical output of the sound chip of my Shuttle!

  TP> Does this mean you trained on about 1100 of each?

The total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5
messages.

I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.

Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.

So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:

class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):

    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }

    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)

This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.

It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).

One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:

> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student

I guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's
estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 

52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average
age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some 
participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. 

At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to
think that some the participants may have actually slowed 
their pace a bit. 

So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could 
easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study
will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active 
sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution
could easily be in the 3000+ range.

Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall 
population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence
of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest 
that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so
people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it
were sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise.

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special ""build"" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:

	the-app 2>&1 | grep dude

Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.

Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

If we are allowed to assume 8.2 or higher, which we can't really, then
we could add

if {![string is integer $select(sel)]} {

We can probably survive with

Test your knowledge with this set of movie quotes. I'll be back in a couple of 
days with the answers.


-  Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? 

-  Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about 
Amanda Jones.

-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely 
unawares.

-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named 
after a famous 19th century ballerina.

-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the 
wound is invariably fatal.

-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my 
dress off, it's _most_ unusual.

-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't 
want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't 
want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in 
advance, so I won't be there.

-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.

-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.

-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet 
smaller than my sister.

-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally 
incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses 
like her mother.

-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.

-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.

-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you 
can lie from any position, can't you?

-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that 
it was going to happen.

-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.

-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are 
the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! 

-  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue 
is whether you are paranoid enough.

-  Inconceivable!
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:

  Using a database:
   real    8m24.741s
   user    6m19.410s
   sys     1m33.650s

  Using a pickle:
   real    1m39.824s
   user    1m36.400s
   sys     0m2.160s

This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).

For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:

   real    0m29.592s
   user    0m28.050s
   sys     0m1.180s

Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though.

I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  

On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.

213,213,Kill Your Gods,"Hindus mourn 'monkey god'


By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in Hyderabad

Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.


The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed

Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.

The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.

It had not eaten for three weeks.

Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.

Garlanded

One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.


The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.

The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.

Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.

'Exploited'

Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
residents.

But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
mistreated.

They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.

The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.

The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

Terminal velocity can be calculated by $v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{CpA}}$
where C is an experimentally determined coefficient, p is the density of the
air, and A is the area of the object. These calculations only work if the
object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity
for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go
faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the
most part. 

All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the
square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I 
really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I
think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of
the atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).

In '87 a guy named Gregory Robertson noticed a fellow parachutist Debbie 
Williams had been knocked unconscious. He shifted so that he was head down,

Battery pack, huh what???

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.

Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a

briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""

Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*

232,232,[zzzzteana] Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest,"Ananova:  
Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest

A controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
project.
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: ""The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it.""
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

233,233,[zzzzteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected,"The Electronic Telegraph

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
2.50 though.

237,237,A Line in the Sand,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841
Date: Not supplied

Bug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic 
browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified 
browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 
and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time 
slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 
policy for regressions.

While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 
misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 
add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 
features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 
relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 
user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 
feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!

You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 
requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 
rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 
people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 
people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 
second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 
continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 
but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 
them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 
sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 
he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 
Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 
to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 
doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 
eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.

We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 
nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 
features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 
Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 
some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 
download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 
will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.

I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter

Just tried smartgroups: The layout of pages is pretty challenging to

there is no way to get out.  You can unsubscribe yourself as the sole
member of a group, but you cannot delete the group.

Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from

I suppose it could be much worse;

To be fair, would this mean that they'd
also immediately pay out the difference
for anyone whose tax basis was greater
than current estate value?

(This is all guess work and may be bogus.)

Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several
co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.

In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.

250,250,] Korea's Real Rage for Virtual Games,"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/09/technology/09KORE.html

Broadband's killer application  the one activity that dwarfs all others 
is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.

""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun
Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
Internet game addiction. ""Young people are losing the ability to relate to
others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
violence, even when they are not playing.

251,251,Optical analog computing?,"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.

See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.

I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....

Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.

hmmm.

Open a terminal and as root type

you want to find a module called

If it isn't loaded then load it.

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. 
""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job
of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I
have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

256,256,[Razor-users] Using razor with maildrop,"Jeff--

What is the maildrop recipe you use with spamassassin?  I was trying to
set mine up but I am running into a few difficulties.

I think I will try spamassassin first and see how it goes, and then
perhaps fold in razor2... is it easy to fold in?

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant 
points in its favor, it still manages to suck, and break across JVMs.

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.

Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
portable JVM that just works.

My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze

September 23, 2002 Monday  Home Edition
SECTION: Main News Main News; Part 1; Page 13; National Desk
LENGTH: 1013 words
BYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER
DATELINE: SEATTLE

BODY:

The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a
public-policy think tank here.

The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into
his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an
unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on
espresso.

That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,
and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one
that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,
after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound
of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000
residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle
also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's
Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.

A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the
tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the
consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,""
said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was
common sense.""

Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that
people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But
because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on
espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.

Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a
year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research
shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.

Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The
think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.

Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs
made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would
provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,
improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.

At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.

Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an
extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with
it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got
to come from somewhere.""

Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she
brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She
supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on
the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.

Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.

David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a
day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for
one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a
leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I
think everyone should pay.""

Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as
JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's
Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,
Starbucks and Tully's.

The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that
contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare
for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If
espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a
city audit.

University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. 

""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is
neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead
to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to
avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using
finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]
and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be
right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal
fees that could have gone to child care.

""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious
idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso
drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with
the espresso drinkers?""

In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public
stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,
corporations continually advertise their commitment to social
activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members
prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.

""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and
childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we
contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not
understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an
additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single
consumer product.""

The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before
voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at
vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.
The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.

Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime
every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.

It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds
funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

	# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.

Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.

The New Yorker

THE NEXT WORLD ORDER
by NICHOLAS LEMANN
The Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.
Issue of 2002-04-01
Posted 2002-03-25

When there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people
often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone
suspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush
Administration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a
father-son team. It's easy for people in the Administration to believe
that, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has
resumed its governance-and about time, too.

The Bush Administration's sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or
worse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.
Republicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and
foreign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as
Clinton's weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national-security adviser, wrote an article in
Foreign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton
of ""an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
commander in chief."" Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this
Administration also served under the President's father. They took office
last year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting
by Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they'd left off.

Not long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration
foreign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval
Room. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose
cover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the
world, and these words:

Defense Strategy for the 1990s:
The Regional Defense Strategy
Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney
January 1993

One of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is
communicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected
politicians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform
publicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
are just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,
and are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go
to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to
explain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior
official handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a
high-school term paper, represent the government version of playing
Carnegie Hall?

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of
Defense, set up a ""shop,"" as they say, to think about American foreign
policy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose
existence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at
a higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of
Defense; Lewis Libby, Cheney's chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior
foreign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of
conservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and
intellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald
Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has
been closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin
Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a
competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine
American foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which
each team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President
Bush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the
new grand strategy.

Everybody worked for months on the ""five-twenty-one brief,"" with a sense
that the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and
Powell arrived at Cheney's office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but
his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,
perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn't
get to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in
the world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,
using material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major
foreign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that
Iraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.

The team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the
material, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon
envisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent
any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of
controversy ensued about the Bush Administration's hawks being
""unilateral""-controversy that Cheney's people put an end to with denials
and the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.

As it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney
team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the
senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before
Clinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a ""scrubbed,""
meaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the
essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the
world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of
skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the
same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""From Containment to Global
Leadership?,"" which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney's team in 1991 and
is now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the
Clinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that
the United States ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the
indefinite future."" Khalilzad writes, ""It is a vital U.S. interest to
preclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary
for the purpose.""

When George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around
him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of
the policy of containment of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence which
the United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major
foreign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that ""a
President must be a clear-eyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to
connote an absence of world-remaking ambition. ""Realism"" is exactly the
foreign-policy doctrine that Cheney's Pentagon team rejected, partly
because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating
world affairs for any length of time.

One gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist
attacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.
Any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush
has done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic
security. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly
entering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that
Bush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,
aggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in
direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,
especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress
since September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which
his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of
destiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,
because it enhances Bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive
policymaking.

Inside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been ""a
transformative moment,"" as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is
not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials
had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American
public's usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at
least for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the ""Black
Hawk Down"" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the
conviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing
Kosovo operation, in Clinton's next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign
military adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the
options are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999
study of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,
which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualty-averse than the
military or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed that
the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to
prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American
death total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September
11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.

Recently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice's
Foreign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: ""The United
States has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest'
in the absence of Soviet power."" I asked her whether that is still the
case. ""I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said
immediately. ""I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes
that clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief."" Like Bush,
she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons
of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the
national interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush's speech to
Congress on September 20th, America's sole grand purpose was ending
terrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the
part of the White House grounds where television reporters do their
standups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does
in public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of
missionary calm, rather than belligerence.

In the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,
putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power
balances"" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she
sounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney's
Pentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the
other great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of
the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""Theoretically, the
realists would predict that when you have a great power like the United
States it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to
challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" Rice said. ""And I think what
you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to
productive and coöperative relations with the United States, rather than to
try to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters
in how it all comes out. It's not all foreordained.""

Rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the
National Security Council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do
you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change American
doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. ""I
really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she said-that is,
the period when the containment doctrine took shape-""in that the events so
clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big
global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally
thought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the
tectonic plates in international politics. And it's important to try to
seize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of
that before they harden again.""

The National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual
document called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals
of American policy-another government report whose importance is great but
not obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the
Clinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is
working on the report now.

""There are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""One is to do it
in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it's our view that,
since this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it's
important. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior
to 9/11. I can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but I
would think sometime this spring. And it's important that it be a real
statement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction
that it's going.""

It seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant
American role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some
questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being
asked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in
foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender
inside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a
couple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive
capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official
adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of
the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now
in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,
and replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush
Administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it
is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few
months ago.

Just before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested
to me that a good indication of a Bush Administration's direction in
foreign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or
Richard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,
and an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he
published a book titled ""The Reluctant Sheriff,"" in which he poked a little
fun at Wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he
called it the ""Pentagon Paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the United
States should try to be the world's only great power over the long term.
""For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" Haass wrote. ""It
simply is not doable."" Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of
the Wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the United States expanding the
""democratic zone of peace"": ""Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.
The United States cannot compel others to become more democratic."" Haass
argued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not
more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional
great-power politics.""

Wolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of
Defense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-
in effect, Colin Powell's big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his
office at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an
array of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,
beginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and
the first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.

It's another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that
Haass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.
""Using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign
policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case
to make,"" he said. ""It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, 'It's the
economy, stupid'-not 'It's the world, stupid.' Two things are very
different now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case
that foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security
charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.""

I asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as
Kennan's containment. ""I think there is,"" he said. ""What you're seeing from
this Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of
ideas-I'm not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the
limits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to
massacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.
If a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of
the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone
inside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,
gain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead
to a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can
act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when,
and not if, you're going to be attacked.""

Clearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. ""I don't think the American public
needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein,"" he said.
""Also, I'd fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the
case. Public opinion can be changed. We'd be able to make the case that
this isn't a discretionary action but one done in self-defense.""

On the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still
maintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long
before called ""Imperial America,"" but he told me that there is a big
difference between imperial and imperialist. ""I just think that we have to
be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""Great as our advantages are, there are
still limits. We have to have allies. We can't impose our ideas on
everyone. We don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to
join us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has
to be multilateral. We can't win the war against terror alone. We can't
send forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor.""

He stopped for a moment. ""Is there a successor idea to containment? I think
there is,"" he said. ""It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.
foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to
certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,
democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies
and then building institutions that lock them in even more.""

The first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new
American foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What
the United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's
been done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the
operation itself and in terms of its aftermath.

Several weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,
the Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of
his aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,
evidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event
was a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi's
leading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former
Defense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely
confident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, ""Evidence is mounting
that the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing
with Saddam Hussein."" The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete
""until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his
regime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt.""

Chalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a
twinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit
and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his
supporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American
support, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the
Taliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in
Washington. It isn't just that Chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel
military leader (""He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray
over tea at the Savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former Pentagon
official told me), or that he isn't in Iraq. It's also that Saddam's
military is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban's was, and has been
quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United
States left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an
internal rebellion; Chalabi's supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker
now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could
finish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea
that a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of
anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground
troops.

Kenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security
Council's staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton
Administration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by
publishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.
This was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors
published an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi
National Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn't
think Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a
substantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one
we used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in
Afghanistan.

Pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a
briefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in
Washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and
walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were
hanging. ""The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion,"" he said, using a
pen as a pointer. ""We're talking about two grand corps, two to three
hundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the
Tigris-Euphrates valley."" He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.
""Ideally, you'd have the Saudis on board."" He pointed to the Prince Sultan
airbase, near Riyadh. ""You could make Kuwait the base, but it's much easier
in Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq""-pointing
again-""because otherwise they'll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil
fields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil
fields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the
Kurds in northern Iraq."" Point, point. ""You go in as hard as you can, as
fast as you can."" He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. ""You get the
enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" His
hand hit the desk again, hard. ""Then you crush him."" Smack.

That would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed
the government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously
shaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,
which before September 11th clearly met the new test of national
unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass
destruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is
not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel
Pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence
service, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,
if America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be
established-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no
obvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn
strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a
nuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal
affairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become
directly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted
to do. So it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way
that Europe was immediately after the Second World War.

In September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate
moves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an
indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration's
conservatives. ""These guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is
close to the high command at the State Department, told me. ""Resistance is
futile."" The conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is
intellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since
September 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least
the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance
practically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the
doctrines of Cheney's old Pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone
of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.

The outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with
the Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,
of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom
see the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis
was invited to the White House in December to brief the senior
foreign-policy staff. ""One point he made is, Look, in that part of the
world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior
official I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn't
proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""Arab street,"" as long as it is
prepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting
thinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay
declared, ""Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,""
and Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published
an article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in
Iran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be
accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)

Several people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the
nations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,
if they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to
finish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney's recent diplomatic
tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely
absorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the
Administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of
the world's approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the
United States should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its
actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure
of international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test
that policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that
it can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly
opposed the Iraq operation.

When the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked
for a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal
2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve
military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as
an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on
terrorism. That's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of
Iraq.

This spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about
the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush
builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the
unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama
involving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring
and summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms
that Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,
are unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the
enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The
Administration obviously feels confident that the United States can
effectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop
buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the
Republican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam
and topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a
full-scale American invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will
begin soon.

Lewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney's
future-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now
works in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the
West Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of
public-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of
his 1996 novel, ""The Apprentice,"" quotes the Times' calling him ""Dick
Cheney's Dick Cheney,"" which seems like an apt description: he appears
absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of
the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly
rumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of
having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction
which the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for
those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only
truly prudent course.

When I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before
September 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been
different. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,
filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle
East. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.

""Let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery
of the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade
Center, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,
former President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a
serious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar
bombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy
bombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of
the Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,
and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the
failure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.
No one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that
long list and you ask, 'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people
from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our
interests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged
further aggressions against U.S. interests?,' many observers conclude no,
and ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise
up and say credibly, 'The Americans don't have the stomach to defend
themselves. They won't take casualties to defend their interests. They are
morally weak.' ""

Libby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been
standard or foreordained. ""Look at what the President has done in
Afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of
Congress""-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. ""He made it
clear that it's an important area. He made it clear that we believe in
expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.
He made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And
he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to
begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is
not a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.
There are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could
have waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged
in long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new
relationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so
afraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn't seek its help. This list could
go on to twice or three times the length I've mentioned so far. But,
instead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while
standing up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don't know
yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not
only with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the
states of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the
states of Southwest Asia more generally.""

We moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein
unacceptable, in the Administration's eyes. ""The issue is not inspections,""
Libby said. ""The issue is the Iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass
destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their
promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made
in '91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems
I listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq
was given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to
take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years.""

""What's your level of confidence,"" I asked him, ""that the current regime
will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?""

He ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke
slowly and deliberately. ""There is no basis in Iraq's past behavior to have
confidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""

Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
By Andrew Marshall

BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.

""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
knew then there was something special.""

Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
who is expecting their first child.

Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
in search of a wife.

""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""

Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
the couple married.

MR. MARRIAGE

Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
agency.

Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.

""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
knowledge, they have all been successful.""

Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.

Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
language problems.

""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""

After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
client has found a potential wife.

""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
usually within the next year.

Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
than 10 percent have broken up.

Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.

""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
down, OK, we'll talk.""'

But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
stress disorder.

WHY?

Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.

But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
need Wan,"" he said.

""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
their future husband.""

Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
choose to use his agency.

His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
not ""God's gift to women.""

Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.

""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
Impossible,"" she said.

""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ladies from other countries.""

Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
not a major obstacle.

""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
very quickly.""

Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
to the West.

""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
how to eat, and when to make tea.""

PITFALLS

But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
back in Bangkok, sad and angry.

""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
spoke to me.""

Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""

Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
unsuitable candidates are weeded out.

""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
comers.""

Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
looking for a foreign husband.

""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

This is very good news! Will this allow for individual spam word file

Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).

Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.

But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head

A New Theory on Mapping the New World

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

Using satellites to monitor global climate change

SUMMARY

As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.

The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.

Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.



GATHERING THE DATA

While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.

The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.

Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.



VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS

A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.

To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.

He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.

""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""

The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.

Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.

""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""

Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.

While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.

In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.



GLOBAL COVERAGE

One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.

The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.

The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.

Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.

The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.

Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.

While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.

Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.

In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.



INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU

With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.

Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.

Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)

To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.



INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS

Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.



INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY

While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.

The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.

Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.



THE SCIENTISTS

In 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""

AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.

In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.



DR. JOHN CHRISTY

Christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.

OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a

291,291,[IIU] Viruses and Bounced Mail,"All,

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the 
only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

292,292,[PythonAnywhere] Schedule a task to run automatically,"Tick tock tick tock tick tock.  It's the passage of time -- so familiar and yet, so mysterious; there's no good explanation for it in Physics! Will we ever truly understand it? Who knows...

But one thing's for sure, and that's the fact that you can HARNESS THE POWER OF TIME using PythonAnywhere Scheduled Tasks. Something we see you haven't had *time* to do yet, ho ho.[1]

So head on over to the Tasks tab where you'll be able to set any Python script (or, indeed, any other kind of script) to run on a regular basis

https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/suicidbot/tasks_tab/

(Free users can set tasks to run once a day, paying users can schedule hourly tasks)

Here's a few ideas to get you started:

* Send yourself an email once a day reminding you to floss your teeth

* Write a script to scrape daily prices 3D-printed plastic models of classic designs for fire hydrants.  Finally you'll be able to make those crucial buying decisions at the best time!

* Write a twitter bot that posts the time of day once a day, and helpfully @-mentions random people informing them of what time it is

* Download all the books on project gutenberg that were written on that day in history, and compute a hash of their text contents, just because!

Incidentally, using a scheduled task can also be a good way to have a long-running task that restarts automatically if it crashes, for things like async workers, celery and so on.  More info here:

https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/LongRunningTasks

The possibilities are endless.

[1] The original author of this email was already on their final
warning for bad puns, and has now been summarily dismissed.


Happy Scheduling!

=== Scissors === 

I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 

    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 

She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 

I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. 

*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  

=== Waiting for Wireless === 

Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 

=== Irony === 

According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. 

I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 

Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. 

=== Automatic Flush Toilets === 

Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. 

This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. 

=== Arrival === 

I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. 

Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)

I'd suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it's no standard header does most

mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these

BUSH COVERS THE WATERFRONT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but
the president has at least one other thing on his mind this
week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving,
factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and
retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing
day. 

On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to 
see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this 
isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one 
day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the
next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the
1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work
for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the
disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.

Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or
safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao
covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work
stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew 
Iraq would be in here somewhere). ""Union officials quickly
responded that their members have been unloading military cargo
throughout the 10-day shutdown,"" said the L.A. Times, but an
anonymous Bush administration official ""said that only a portion 
of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.""

Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley
would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the
other hand, ""Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the
increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in
polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political
danger to the Republican administration,"" said the San Francisco 
Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll
reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the 
economy. ""Though the administration promised an unbiased
examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his
mind that it was hurting national security and the economy,
andmerited federal intervention,"" said the AP. 

As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor
disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers
simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).
One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'
contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78
days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer

THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP
-----------------------------------------------------------------
wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry ""fowl."" 
We mean ""foul."" The two dominant direct broadcast satellite
players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big
Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice
Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of
DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite 
service in the US.

The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed
merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- 
it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and
$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as 
some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,
and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV
and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?

The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold
off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice
Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified
""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with
Justice in the next weeks.

The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those
revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies
to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted 
to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the 
cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.

TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for
investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for
expanded-service television may be nearing saturation.
TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,
""Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but
shareholders may realize much smaller returns.""

The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch 
waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for
DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the
current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  

For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

Date: Not supplied

John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. 

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 

There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

301,301,chronous I/O (was Re: Gasp!),"Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.

More details about these are at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/

None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.

POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.

It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.

Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.

In detail, he wrote:

Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
performance.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.

Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.

Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
polls them.

I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

One thing I _think_ you might be doing slightly wrong is your
specification of prefixes.  --prefix is the directory to be used as root
for _installing_ files.  Typically packages use /usr/local as default
(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in
/usr/local/doc and so forth).
Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not
further specify things like --exec-prefix.

Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in
which case ignore me!

I'd make the same remarks about prefixes here.  I would use the command
    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local

To get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is
    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/
(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local
Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp

A command you would have found useful would have been
    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print
Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.

A program which is very useful is checkinstall
http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
It allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).
Instead of ""make install"" type ""checkinstall"", and a package is put
together and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be.

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

Tourism is the world's largest industry. Using this
to preview your travels, or figure out where you are,
would be very valuable.

Online gaming continues to grow. Screw ""Britannia"", 
real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/
conquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real-
time-strategy games.

And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an
ideal display substrate for all sorts of other 
overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D
maps of everywhere which can have many other static 
and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. 

(Combining those last two thoughts: consider the
static world map, in faded colors, with patches
here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched
over the static info in bright colors... it'd be
like the ""fog of war"" view in games like Warcraft,

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week

you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.

It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the 
point of the earlier 3-person example. 

But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. 

Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.

Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.

Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").

Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to
make it more defensible. What I objected to was:

Robert Harley:
# >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous
# >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.
# 
# Well, DUH!!!
# 
# It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
# precisely identical between males and females.
# 
# Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.

If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? 

If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
precisely identical""? 

If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an
anthrolopology professor's conclusions? 

> Actually, you probably just

You are welcome to that theory!

But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing 
and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. ""DUH!!... perfectly obvious... 
exactly, precisely identical..."" -- and that pronouncement is 
itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of 
popping your balloon.

316,316,Janis Ian interviewed on Slashdot,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85482094
Date: Not supplied

Janis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented 
science fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot 
groupmind about her views on the music industry. 

    Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - 
    not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux 
    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy 
    saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is 
    that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. 
    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a 
    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the 
    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to 
    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an 
    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic 
    shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring 
    about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market 
    consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less 
    ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the 
    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because 
    that's all you'll be able to find out there.

Error Message: Barney Not Found[1]. Microsoft ActiMates Interactive Barney may 
conflict with a wide range of radio-operated electronic devices, including 
burglar alarms, resulting in the dreaded &#8220;Barney Not Found&#8221; error. 
To resolve this problem, Microsoft recommends turning off your burglar alarm.

321,321,[Razor-users] Viewing my trust rating?,"Hey Folks

I know this question gets asked a lot, but I haven't seen an answer lately.

Any idea when a user will be able to view his own trust rating?   What are
the plans for this?  Will it be built into the client, web based, emailed
to you nightly?  If you could share your brainstorming on the subject, I
would greatly appreciate it.

Exactly -- ""let's you and him fight"" is a
way of dealing with troublesome populations
by moving them next to one another, so they
give each other, and not the Man, grief*.

So by my understanding (and, you all will
understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):

Ireland:  Irish?  Uppity barbarians overly
   fond of ""risings"".  Scots?  More uppity
   barbarians overly fond of ""risings"".
   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
   next to the former and kill two birds
   with one stone?

Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians
   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy
   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why
   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
   to the former and kill two birds with one
   stone?

but not:

India: in which the muslims and hindus were
    originally intermixed to some degree,
    but Partioned due to their own conflict,
    not due to English resettlement policy.

Canada: in which the french and english were
    already established, and it was just the
    balance of power on the continent that
    determined events in the colonies.  The
    Acadians got resettled, but they don't
    seem to have been that good for picking
    fights with their neighbors, so no one
    had them plonked down next door.

Check the procmail documentation.  They actually recommend:

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
it up. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption

Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

That begged to try it again but with Tokenize/retain_pure_html_tags false.
The random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here,

here is the same as the sole false positive on the half&half run reported in

My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
(quite the opposite, in fact).

I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

By ""meanings have evolved"" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words
have changed meaning or that our understanding of the Hebrew words have
changed? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had
evolved by time of the Pentateuch?

> In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was

This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the
Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg
Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.

In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar
claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments:

""""""

We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an
issue.

This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our
knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word ""ratsach"". Most modern
translations I've seen translate it ""murder"" but elsewhere the word is
used
of an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers
wouldn't use the word ""murder"").

You'd have to explain ""found in the wild"".  For example, I know of

When we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we
noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.

The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.

(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)

Mebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.
It's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their
sacriments.

And which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and

episodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized
to become a ""lethal force"", or would they have just said, ""Oh well,
there goes /that/ democracy!"" and settle in under communist rule?

Just wondering.

    >> 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.

It is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint
Chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was
a major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous
interview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his
point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states
so easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.

The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that
escalation of violence is not a solution.

I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

Let me get this straight; a registry key is loaded from the server onto 
the client workstations who can modify it, then write it back onto the 
server's own registry - which is not going to use it?

What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server 
itself is not using it?
I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.

And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide 
open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.

If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

I suppose this could finish over the course of an afternoon.  Now where's
""somewhere""?  I expect we'll eventually collect several datasets;
SourceForge isn't a good place for it (they expect projects to distribute
relatively small code files, and complain if even those get big).

What then are we training the classifier to do?  Graham's scoring scheme is
based on an assumption that the ham-vs-spam task is *easy*, and half of that
is due to that the ham has a lot in common.  It was an experiment to apply
his scheme to all the comp.lang.python traffic, which is a lot broader than
he had in mind (c.l.py has long had a generous definition of ""on topic""
<wink>).  I don't expect good things to come of making it ever broader,
*unless* your goal is to investigate just how broad it can be made before it
breaks down.

Which is ""a feature"" from Graham's POV:  the more clues, the better this
""smoking guns only"" approach should work.

Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
centers that
have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
to this is that many college graduates
 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
that we are the thin edge
(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
third-world wages and work practices coming
 to North America.

I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
could maintain that (and prosper) just says
 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
place.

And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
the labor markets here.

Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
produce profits for the favored few.

I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
and lie - use
the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.

And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
standards of living) is the reality.

Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:

""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
the top 20% of households""

It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of

Easy.

First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.

Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:

*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen

Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook""
under Prefs->Hacking Support)

It's going to look something like this:

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...]
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)

You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
time!

365,365,[zzzzteana] 'Lost' penguins found alive,"Evening Standard - 28 August 2002

[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA]

 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda

 A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a ""big huddle"". 

 The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter."" 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

Good way, heres one that worked for me.

Work on a database project with that person. After a while hand her the

If when you come back she is talking to the person in the next cube about

No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use,
which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
services better.

The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.

Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

Ok, some more nits: alsa-xmms doesn't work if I don't have
alsa-lib-devel installed, but xmms dies on startup telling me:

   Cannot load alsa library: libasound.so: cannot open shared object

libasound.so is part of alsa-lib-devel... if I install it, the ALSA XMMS

I can't install the xine stuff, because xine-libs needs libGLcore.so.1,
which I can't find anywhere (NVidia stuff?  I have Radeon 7500...)

Don't swallow too quickly what you have read about

When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them ""development"" free.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
of America"" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

What happened to more highly-capitalized

sounds like it might sidestep that.

379,379,[zzzzteana] That wacky imam,"http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

382,382,[ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2,"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.

 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default

Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file 
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This 
happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.
That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to 
have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what 
messages are in this sequence?"".  One option would have been to add another 
call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time 
technique would be less error-prone.

I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow 
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the 
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences 
for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.

And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the
dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are
melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is,
people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate

AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks

If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, ""the No.
1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
[New York's] Upper East Side.

""It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store""
on Madison Avenue, which features ""rich vulnerable women,"" the mag's
October issue says.

AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
place published, or being cited as the ""in"" place for finding loaded women
- or rather, women who are loaded.

""The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!"" an AA
spokesman told The Post.

No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer,
but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are
instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile
process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions
e.g. ""#include <math.h>"" gives you maths type functions.  Since they
start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation.

Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.

I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).

For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful
compilation.

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

On my box the current system scores about 50 msgs per second (starting in
memory, of course).  While that can be a drag while waiting for one of my
full test runs to complete (one of those scores a message more than 120,000
times, and trains more than 30,000 times), I've got no urge to do any speed

drag.  Guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his

I haven't profiled yet, but *suspect* there aren't any egregious hot spots.
5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive
*when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach to
non-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speeding
something that ought to be replaced entirely).

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

 August 28, 2002
 
 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic, Mr Bamping said. Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; theres more of them. 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the societys Scottish arm, said: Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I dont
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders. 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

Horrors. Applets are kinda sucky. The cool kids are using Java to write

The giggle-inducing irony of the whole Java thing is how Sun's strategy
backfired. They produced a platform that was supposed to dwell on the
client side, where it would commoditize those clients. Instead, it turns
out to be the perfect language to write server applications in, and it has
successfully commoditized servers. Ooops!

This is exactly what I think. SpamAssassin has always been conservative

I say start it with a zero score and put it in 70_cvs_rules_under_test like
any other unproven rule. Then score it based on actual results, not
promises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message
with a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn't impress me and it wouldn't
impress the GA either. Rules with exactly the same statistics are being
dropped from SA right now, and I don't see why this should be any different.

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
players.

Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.

Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
under any other guise.

Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
European way of doing things is beyond me.

The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 

For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
years.

I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.

First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.

Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?

In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
understand a word they are saying either.

Such as?

Anything equivalent will be spam, just not email spam.  Dump entry IPs for

This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware

approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

One drawback : They changed from pspell to aspell apparently, and it
requires aspell >= 0.50 which isn't even in Rawhide, so spell checking is
disabled for now until I take a decision about it :-/

If I build recent aspell packages, they may not be upgraded when ungrating

435,435,Steven Levy's wireless neighbors,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85534626
Date: Not supplied

After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
""Hackers"" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. ""The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that,"" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Because�and this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumbling�when you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygen�and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument 
against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.

Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put 
/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.

If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.

> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! 

It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)

Good luck,

Date: Not supplied

Javawalk is a coffee-oriented walking-tour of San Francisco. 

    Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square 
    and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's 
    Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more 
    significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool 
    weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. 
    Lucky us!

A terrible argument. There are better technical solutions to privacy

441,441,2000+ year old Greek computer reinterpreted,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85507259
Date: Not supplied

The Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is 
thought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial 
bodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: 

    The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for 
    celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in 
    which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that 
    itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that 
    the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of 
    the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by 
    Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model 
    derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, 
    were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the 
    second century AD.) 

    A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus 
    does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been 
    built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the 
    three other planets known at the time�Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other 
    words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known 
    celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, 
    using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the 
    zodiac running round its edge.

443,443,Anolther sequence related traceback,"I have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now.   (It is
amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for
UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and
its battery supply...)

First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was
occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a
sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of
such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.
This one solves the initial problem:

+	    continue;
+	}
 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -]
 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} {
 	    lappend seq $parts


That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring
before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should
probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue""
if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).

But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,
by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,
I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than
have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it
would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to
do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck
a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the
user has typed.

This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe
allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can
be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have
to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.

But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.
If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that
is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a
different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the
current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current
input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it,
I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That
kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.

And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special
use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from
the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different
restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name
beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,
so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to
toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name
being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I
can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to
exist and be typed.

Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another
feature that has always bugged me.   In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is
the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and
the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now
show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.
So I ""fixed"" this one as well.   ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes
that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something
else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it
discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order
to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.

And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it
clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).
Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next
message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had
reverted to its usual bindings.

In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe
that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the
""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really
need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just
for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not
the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).

In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale,

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order 
over $25"", ""buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free"", ""free popcorn 
with any movie rental"", ""free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter"", 
""the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore"".

Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.

I don't endorse the whole RIAA thing, but to be accurate, you would
have to duplicate the chair so that both you and your neighbour could
continue to sit down, and yes, I suppose that would be more serious.

They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups
of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell
money.  For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as
(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the
patented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar
on eBay with ""Gibson"" written in crayon on the headstock, and then
claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get
upset.

    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away
    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  

To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,
it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution
rights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't
stop you from making 10000 copies to sell.

    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  

This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?
The ""other stuff"" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?

Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to ""own"" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah
McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's
the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)

But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches,
think again.

The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.

Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.

Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them; the songs are already theirs.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

Cheers,
RAH

456,456,My Good Easy,"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/07.html#my_good_easy
Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00

_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 

I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 

On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 

I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. 

In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 

In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 

I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 

I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 

I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. 

Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI
[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept

There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the

That does not make a difference.

It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from

configure that probably.

Any idea how I would do this?

Bob,

This guy's an idiot.

I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864
of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules
each.  They weigh 125 kg.

You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked
maximizes that.

It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking
and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need
voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual
capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them
arranged in series to boost the voltage.

Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time.

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like
1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible
to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for
accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.
(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)

Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few
real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were
talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the
wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,
it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady
discharge curve.

But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not
the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those
you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole
atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with
a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,
and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.

I had to laugh at Rumsfield yesterday - when he was heckled by 
protestors, he said something like ""They couldn't do that in Iraq."" 
Meanwhile, from what I could tell, the protestors were being arrested.

473,473,[zzzzteana] Plumstead Panther - Pictures!,"Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...

A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?


http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html


Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.

Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.

Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.

The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.

He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.

""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""

The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.

His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.

She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""

Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.

He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""

Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.

If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

Maxtor Driving Capacity-Centric Enterprise Apps With ""Super-Sized"" ATA Drives

Maxtor Continues its Leadership in the Market it Pioneered with a New 
Category of High-Density ATA Drives

MILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-

Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and 
data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest 
generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging 
enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and 
network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: 
huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; 
and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to 
failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.

The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" 
archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive 
architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including 
executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be 
recovered on demand.

These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the 
storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, 
these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced 
starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers 
high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between 
traditional ATA and SCSI drives.

For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, 
easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server 
environments.

""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies 
are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, 
financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior 
director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may 
not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but 
when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA 
technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our 
legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA 
hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these 
enterprise applications.""

The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for 
capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for 
capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage 
density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been 
tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, 
already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, 
which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a 
three-year warranty.

The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM 
UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. 
The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation 
serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum 
data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace 
with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive 
environments and enterprise applications.

With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for 
managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA 
advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. 
The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn 
allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with 
increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.

""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that 
has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, 
analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and 
when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling 
cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have 
been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""

Availability
Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine 
II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in 
the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus 
II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments 
scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.

Everything else :)  I can't even mark text in an exmh message window

either).

  BTW: talking of spring downunder... I'm in Queensland.  It almost
  feels like early summer already (winters here are dry and warm,
  much better than cold wet miserable Melbourne :-)  Despite some
  recent rain (first in months), we are already into a drought, with
  an El-Nino on the way it is only going to get worse...  (the last
  one in the 90s caused one of the worst droughts ever seen here in
  aussie).

Yes, but that probably means that you have to have exmh
running on the laptop to get the notification?
With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the
same time, this creates the problem that I cannot  run to the
closest compter to check out the new mail.

But thanks for the hint, I might use that for some other
hack ;-)

Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)

I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.

My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.

I'll post my own repository story here anyway, hope no-one minds.
It may freely be commented on or used in another text.

I have a directory like this:
$ tree  -d
.
|-- current7
|   |-- SRPMS.current
|   |-- SRPMS.gcc3
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.current
|       |-- RPMS.gcc3
|       `-- base
|-- redhat-7_2
|   |-- SRPMS.os
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.os -> <link to RH network install image>
|       `-- base
`-- testing
    |-- SRPMS.testing
    `-- redhat
        |-- RPMS.testing
        `-- base

27 directories

I throw updates to current7's rpms and my own stuff (with makefile :) to
testing.
After each new package, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
testing/redhat testing

(for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for
exmple)

This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.

As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
 

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that
is the envy of most of the world.

Also this new spec looks like the old one, it got libdv and libdv-devel
in the BuildRequires so I just used the normal spec and removed it manully.

Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.

A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.

The above steps can all be performed ""automatically"",
if the .spec files are updated to include the necessary

This would make the building of the .rpm files less
error prone and more self-contained, and it would be
somewhat self-documenting.

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll.  The .exes are cmdline programs.  One is a POP3 proxy.  If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.  In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and ""all it does"" is
insert a

    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and ""do
something about it"" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much <wink>).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.

The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.

While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
risk to humans.

""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
uncertainties are involved.""

The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.

EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.

The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
is expected to produce pollution reductions.

The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
gauging pollution health concerns.

But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
cancer risk to an individual.

Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
environmental exposure.""

The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.

Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.

Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""

Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""

The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a

family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The

DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up

to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company

itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,

while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes

and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of

XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application

co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in

May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

========================================================================
=

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of

products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,

drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

Still worthwhile -- 1.257% is not that bad.  :-)

My results:

The interesting thing is that these hits all seem to be rot13 versions
of the To: address.  If we ever start getting FPs (or if anyone is
worried), we could make it an eval test for rot13 of the To: address
(turning non-word characters into ""."" characters in the regular

At the same time, it might be worth testing for username in HTML

haven't seen enough hits so far to bother (however, I did add a really
good test for email addresses in comments).

  | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).

Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.

  | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
  |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.

Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.

But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".

Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).

No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told

_Law.com_: Suit Over Airlines' Web Sites Tests Bounds of ADA[1]. [via Slashdot:

    Gumson and a Miami Beach, Fla.- based disability rights group, Access Now, 
    filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Miami in June and July against 
    Dallas- based Southwest and Dallas-based American Airlines under the 
    Americans with Disabilities Act. They are doing so under an untested legal

""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.


""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.

I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.

The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:


Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.


Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.

The statute of limitations:


507. Limitations on actions

(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.

(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.

The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.

I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

506,506,[ILUG] serial port transient failure,"Here's a weird and wacky problem:

I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.

This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.

Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

Mixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. 

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). 

Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are planning 
on making money from the spam.  What a court would consider evidence of being 
the spammer is another question.

That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.

If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.

SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that 
look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still 
mean that ""The U.N. is going to invade America!"" spams with SWE would get 
through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.

My next (current) task is to complete the corpus I've got - it's currently
got ~ 9000 ham, 7800 spam, and about 9200 currently unsorted. I'm tossing 
up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  - previously
I've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to 
pop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too, too
tedious.

I can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of
the more 'interesting' uglies. One thing I've seen (consider this 
'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the 
f-ps.

535,535,use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from a    ttacks,"I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.

A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.

It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 

BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks


Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.

""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""

Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""

""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""

Status:   False.

Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop

Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality

Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all

Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into

What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

Oh well.  Fair enough.

Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)

What I've done instead is to create a tiny little ""kernel.spec"" that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make
alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have
thought of this approach sooner.

I guess I was sleepier than I thought.  I managed to cut and
paste the _right_ stuff from the app-defaults file into the
Bindings definition dialog without ever noticing that it was
different from what was in my exmhbindings file.

P.S., can I get a pointer to a freeware Tcl/Tk debugger?

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
""nomime"" => 1?

Thanks,

I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day, constantly polling 
for mail. If they go away for a long weekend, lots of ""friday night spam"" will become 
ham on sunday night.  (Friday night seems to be the most popular time)


> - Your idea here.

Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular email clients"".. As a 
stop-gap to the auto-ham ..

How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email 
clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move ""spam"" into the spam 
folder. 

Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can 
quickly move ham into the ham folder.

In either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.

566,566,Validation,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85395270
Date: Not supplied

I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].

I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:

_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._

Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. 

Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?

""I told you so."" never felt so good.

Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or
making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong,
immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and
the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or
some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to
get attention is fine.

Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself
off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were
not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing
about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police
arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That
attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what
you believe.

Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get
in someone's face.

One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking
out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.
They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public
listen to them on matters of national security?

So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your
answr boils down to ""i don't give a shit about what happens to the US"", you

That was my thinking.  My recollection about the first message being valid
is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,
for example, or you are selecting a message to display.

glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *
will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.
But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.
Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is
already pretty tricky

 > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that
we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change
every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder.

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London

James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

582,582,DataPower announces XML-in-silicon,"If it's not stateful, it wouldn't seem to be worth the effort, although I guess it might help with DDoS attacks.

Sounds snake-oilish to me, but I'm biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy servers, and the limitations thereof.

> DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed

> performance, 
> according to company officials.
> 
> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the

> startup. The 
> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
> data.
> 
> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data 
> between two 
> businesses.
> 
> ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
> ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
> 
> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the 
> file size up 
> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
> alternative.
> 
> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
> importance in the world of XML.
> 
> ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
> said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
> Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
> 
> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
> 
> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach 
> the company 
> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with 
> regards to speed 
> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
> 
> ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
> adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that 
> he believes 
> will be mostly false.
> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes 
> of a packet, 
> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 
> 1,400 bytes 
> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
> 
> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large 
> collection of 
> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the 
> markup language 
> as they pass through the device.
> 
> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and 
> will identify 
> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
> 
> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an 
> application 
> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators 
> more granular 
> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
> controls the device.
> 
> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging

> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega

See the checkin comments for timtest.py last night.  Adding this code gave a
major reduction in the false negative rate:

def crack_content_xyz(msg):
    x = msg.get_type()
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-type:' + x.lower()

    x = msg.get_param('type')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-type/type:' + x.lower()

    for x in msg.get_charsets(None):
        if x is not None:
            yield 'charset:' + x.lower()

    x = msg.get('content-disposition')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-disposition:' + x.lower()

    fname = msg.get_filename()
    if fname is not None:
        for x in fname.lower().split('/'):
            for y in x.split('.'):
                yield 'filename:' + y

    x = msg.get('content-transfer-encoding:')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-transfer-encoding:' + x.lower()


...

    t = ''
    for x in msg.walk():
        for w in crack_content_xyz(x):
            yield t + w
        t = '>'

I *suspect* most of that stuff didn't make any difference, but I put it all
in as one blob so don't know which parts did and didn't help.

589,589,Java is for kiddies,"<snip>
Misc rants about finding jobs, java vs C, what makes a good programmer, etc.
</snip>

Okay, hmm, I thought twice about this, but what the hey, jobs are hard to
come by. There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good
hackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking
and good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're
looking for a few ""really good programmers"", says the CTO. I know him --
very smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth.

Joe Bob says ""check it out"". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can
send it straight to them. Probably won't matter if I pass it on, since I
don't know you guys anyway...

 This is a pain. 

 The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:

 rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*

 RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.
The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human
activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating
after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that
these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for
increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.

Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the
past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming
isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to
understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on
global human activity.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.

It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment
subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the
current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2
concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth
should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may
be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I
encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to
eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident
as heat.
